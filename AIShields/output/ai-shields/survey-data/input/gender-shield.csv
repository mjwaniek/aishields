What can I say, I prefer the path less traveled and wholeheartedly welcome their divergence into such dishes as sweet potatoes falafel and shrimp pita with apple butter and lemon cream.   The shawarma pita was superb. An elevated take on you're average greasy wrap, their fresh baked pita is already epic and then filling it with tangy chicken, veggies, potato chips and pickles just knocks it off the cliff.  I'm already craving eating another one!!  The sweet potato falafel didn't seem to interest me, but after trying it, I quickly changed my tune; crisp outside and moist inside they are at once slightly sweet and savory and addictive as all hell.

Then in January I was told that five star furniture caught on fire and that they couldn't help and to call back in a couple of months. Of course I understood and was patient. I called again in March. I was told to call back in April because Bill the owner was in China getting parts and supplies for the store. It is now May! I just called again and spoke with Bill who told me that he cannot fix my couch until his new store opens and simply hung up on me!!! Worst company I have ever done business With!

Nice and close to MRU on 37th, Hanami has great service and reasonable prices - and as a bonus, its relatively undiscovered nature means that you almost never have to wait in line in the evenings (for lunch, I can't comment).   The spicy tuna salad is piled high with tuna, crispy lettuce, and plenty of spicy sauce. It's a bit of an odd dish, and while it wasn't on point for my companion I would certainly order it again.   The sunomono is a decent size for the price, and quite tasty, and the portion of ""appetizer"" yam tempura is enough for a meal. The yam tempura roll is also generously portioned and topped with a sweet sauce that makes it extra scrumptious.  Also of note is the salmon sashimi portion size - I'm always impressed when they come out, and the tuna (although not quite as remarkable) is a good size as well.   My informal price estimate it about a 15-20% edge on something like Globefish, which makes a hearty sushi for two $45ish instead of $60ish - and that's good with me.

Both have good biryanni rice but Lasani is drier and has slightly more spices.   I like the naan more at Shaheen's because it stretches more and is less thin, but both are very good for their naan.

We ordered the three dishes I mentioned above and four orders of garlic and plain naan. We only finished half of what we ordered but it made for great leftovers the next day! Portions may not look large at first but it's very generous. Pricing is also good.  Service: In the beginning we had to wait a bit for our server to come back to take our orders. After that it was great service. Our glasses of water were refilled every 15 min. Staff is very friendly.  Atmostphere: Loved it! Nice decor and great lighting.

98;F;0.6662753670599685;"""I love Indian food, definitely a favorite cuisine for me. I keep coming back to Delhi and its becoming my new favorite indian restaurant in town.   It seems this place must do the majority of business during their lunch buffet because each time we have dined in the evening it's been dead. I don't mind a quiet restaurant...actually I prefer to feel like I have a restaurant all to my self but it makes me worried that somehow this restaurant is hurting. I hope not! I would hate to see another great Indian restaurant close.   The service here is great, the owner is always floating around and managing every aspect. You can tell he is passionate about his restaurant and it really shines through the service and food.   The Food  Chicken Tikka Masala Amazing. Perfect balance of cream, tomato and masala spices. Not too oily and great depth of flavor. Chicken is succulent and juicy, only gripe is there is not enough chicken but I deal with it because their sauce is that good.  Naan Airy pockets with doughy edges and just the perfect amount of seasonings. Heavenly! Always so fresh and so darn addicting and their garlic version is a standout.   Tandoori  Have tried both chicken and shrimp. By far my favorite was the shrimp. I've always preferred a shrimp tandoori anyway because there is nothing more visually appetizing than large juicy shrimp and fresh onions and lemons sitting atop a sizzling hot plate. Those sexy soft hissing and popping noises get me every time.    Matter Paneer  Well I have had better IMO but it wasn't bad. I think it's too forward with tomato and I'm searching for more creamy notes. Which is silly when you think about it, there is paneer in there and that should somehow be enough, maybe a touch more cream would make it better? I don't know.   Malai kofta  Sauce 10! Dumplings 0! Way too dense and I like when they are shaped into round balls instead of those football shaped things. I'm totally just whining here, shape shouldn't matter but the shape coupled with how dense they were just didn't do it for me. But that sauce though! Their cashew based sauces are amazing.   Gulab Jamun Again another too dense item but I don't hold that against them. I've experienced the same dense issue at other restaurants regarding this dessert. Maybe was cooked or sitting too long? Not sure.  Mango lassi Dare I say this was made with canned mango? I hope I'm wrong here but I'm pretty sure it wasn't fresh mango. Still tasty nonetheless especially as the alcoholic version.   All in all this place is excellent. Great dishes full of flavor and wonderful attentive service.

They serve coffee, tea, beer, wine, sandwiches, lovely small desserts and a small but tasty menu (that I'm assuming changes up depending on the season given their 'organic' focus from what I read on their website).  Both our coffees/cappuccinos were tasty and the small strawberry dessert I ordered hit the spot with just the right amount of custard to go with. My girlfriend ordered a croissant that was heated up in the kitchen. Rather than simply serve my dessert and then bring the croissant after it was heated, she waited and brought both at the same time. Excellent service in that regard.

I asked that the door says it closes at 8:30pm, she said ""Yeah, the manager decided to close early this week, because he thinks it won't do much business"", she also said, the thinks it's unfair but no in her hands.  2) Small ""ice cream"" shake is $4, couldn't taste any ice cream and the potion size was tiny. You get double out of  a small ice shake in Work's or other burger joints.  3) Waiter also forgot to add napkin to my take out order. I was left eating a greasy burger in my car without napkins.  4) Taste - What I had was definitely not the best in Toronto. It wasn't bad, cooked and seasoned properly, but tasted mediocre. Maybe their signature burgers are better, but since they were closing, the couldn't make me any.  I emailed the owner regarding store hours, and he said the store hours would be followed from now and also offered me 2 combos.

Jimmy the Greek makes so much better food with cheap prices. I love Jimmy the Greek's roast chicken dinner, but it seems Mr. Greek Express didn't have anything like that, so I ordered some chicken breast, which was under their chef specialties category. The girl asked me if I wanted 1 piece chicken breast or 2, I said 1. When the ""chef"" put the chicken breast on the grill, I was like ""that small""?! The price for the meal was like 12.95 or something plus tax, so I expected more than that small piece. Anyways it took them like 10 mins to make a express meal like that.

I actually came here after getting my hair done at Salon de Elephant - it's just a short walk away.    The service was pretty cold and unfriendly, but I'm generally okay with that if the food makes up for it.  Which it didn't.  I mean, it was alright, and the chicken wasn't too raw, which some people have said can happen, but it was average.  Actually, I think the spices might have been toned down for local palates.  The portions were smaller compared to competitors with similar prices - there was a lot of salad.    I prefer their competitors over them though, because their meat isn't juicy enough.  Kebab is inherently a dry meal - grilled meat and rice with no sauce - so the meat needs to be really juicy and impart flavour to the rice.  At Taftan, the meat is dryer and there's less of it in proportion to rice.  I'd reather go to Tah Deeg up the street!

Many items didn't have labels so it was hard to differentiate. Everything was barely warm, not even somewhat hot and almost cold even! What they said was general tso tasted like manchurian. Service was terrible! Waiters didn't wait the tables and just sat in back. I had 3 plates sitting on my table from buffet (plates with food left) and no one picked them up while I ate. No water was poured and when I asked for ice they never brought it. I waited several minutes for someone to come give me my bill and finally got up to go to front desk and finally someone noticed. There were mosquitos and fruit flies all over the table area and bar. I got bitten by mosquitos couple times even. Get pest control! My change was to include some dollar bills and 23 cents but the guy just gave me the bills and no change - who does that? Give exact change and then take your tip.

Villa Madina is a family favourite. We have grown with the restaurant. However, it hurts my heart to tell you how terrible this place has become. Originally, we were given huge portions for amazing prices, and welcoming customer service. Today, the prices are ridiculous, the portions are half of what they should be, and the staff is the rudest of all the restaurants I have visited. If you desire shawarma, I would run the OPPOSITE direction of any Villa Madina location, not just the one at Square One. Please, do yourself and favour and remove Villa Madina from your memory.

Opened two credit cards this summer, and the lady working at this location told me I won't be charged interest on either card for the first 16 months. Sweet! To my surprise, however, I noticed recently that on ONE card I was being charged interest monthly since I got it. I contacted customer support by email to dispute the charges and they informed me that I am charged interest on that card. I thought there must be a mistake, so I found my paperwork that I got when I opened that card. I was shocked to see it DOES state interest will be charged on purchases but not on transfers. Regardless, why wasn't I made aware of that by the teller before I started using my card?

The pool was is such a bad condition that it's been leaking water 1 inch a day thru a 3 feet long underwater crack on the pool wall. Also the land settlement around the pool caused its cool deck breaking into several big pieces, resembling an earthquake road surface seen in movies. It was so bad that we went to the city to obtain a license to demolish the whole pool, at which time Kyle came in to take a last look.  He was very responsive, honest, and knowledgeable. We commissioned him to repair the pool. He started on schedule, sending photos to us for every work he did at the end of the day (we live out of state).  During the project, I came to the house for a few days and meet him in person. He is very pleasant and thinking things from our perspectives. Again, he is responsive: when I talked with his colleague about tile choices, he showed up in a couple of hours bringing a full box of samples and went over the details with me.  His honesty won our trust. Before start, he warned us that some of the suction heads may be replaced. At the end he was able to use the existing ones and save us money not replacing them.  The result is amazing. The earthquake-like cool deck is all flat and fresh and the pool looks like a Caribbean paradise. We can't believe our eyes. His work improves our property value.

We ordered Chinese bhel, regular bhel, 2 Frankie's (one of them was vegan as mentioned in the menu!!), ragda chat. And pav bhaji. We got 4 orders of the 6. Each order took 15 minutes to come out. There is so much chaos amongst the staff. They are not one bit friendly. I think one of the servers got fired, since there was a confusion in the order and we ended up cancelling it. The owner comes to us asking us about the cancelled order and goes inside. We hear yelling and shouting about our order. Then the server storms out of the kitchen using ""f"" words.

I'm not too adventurous when it comes to Indian food due to being a wimp to spicy foods, but I really wanted to give it a try based on the previous great reviews.  The inside is very clean, quiet, and modest. It is quite spacious inside. We were seated at a booth which was a little lower than I'm used to, but no big deal.  The buffet had popular Indian dishes like rice, chicken tikka masala, butter chicken, palak paneer, chickpea curry, spicy vegetables, and plain naan. They also provided a small salad bar and rice pudding for dessert.    The food was excellent, though it could have been a bit warmer to my liking. Also, nothing in the salad bar area was marked with signs - they had a few sauces and/or dressings, but as I do not frequent Indian restaurants I was not sure what they were.   Also they only had one person on staff and the lunch seemed to be a bit busier than normal, probably because it was a holiday and many people were off of work. Because of this, it took a while to get my water refilled, but again, she was very busy so i didn't lower the rating because of it.

I was so excited that I went to this restaurant 4 times during the grand opening week, however my last 2 experience have been nothing short of terrible. Given how popular the buffet was, they quickly increased the price from 9.99 to I believe 13.99. As you note from my prior pictures, they did not hire any additional staff so it was 2 waiter/waitress covering the entire restaurant. Now this is a delayed review from 3-4 months back so I don't know if they changed anything. Food was running out at the buffet table and no refills for those items for the duration of our meal. When food came out, it was a crazy rush to the line. All and all if they have no hired new staff and you keep jacking up the price, you will find your customers going elsewhere.

I'm fairly new to Indian food (only been eating it for a few months), but it's definitely high-quality. The chili paneer appetizer has a really incredible chili flavor that I have not had anywhere else. It's almost sweet in its flavor, but it has a bite to it. The palak paneer is also very good, but I almost wish they put a little bit less paneer cheese in it because my favorite part of the dish is the ""palak"" portion.

506;F;0.7180378351404215;"""I came here with 13 other people for a birthday last night. It was a Saturday night but the restaurant wasn't so busy. This might have something to do with the fact that there was a huge storm out or maybe just due to the poor reviews.  We were in the VIP room and it was super nice, with a spacious table and a big tv. The highlight of the evening was the service. Our waitress was very friendly and handled our large group very well. All the meals came out around the same time and they came around frequently to ask us how we were doing and if they could get us anything. They did take a while to fill up waters but I'll be forgiving.  On first glance, I found the menu to be odd. It seemed to be Italian mostly but there are a handful of asian-inspired dishes and a section of more american, burger and fry dishes. It was confusing and it made me hesitant to order the Italian food because I don't love americanized Italian cuisine. I ended up going with the California Chicken Burger which was chicken, swiss cheese, pancetta, guacamole, mango, tomato and lettuce. I took it with fries which ended up being the best part of the meal. The chicken itself was flavourless and kind of artificial-tasting. I thought mango was a really good idea in this type of sandwich but they put a few tiny shredded pieces so you couldn't really taste it. The bun was huge (too big) but tasty. Overall, for 16.50$, I don't think it was worth it and found it to be expensive for what it was. Meh  Everyone seemed pretty happy with their meals and there were no major complaints.

Patrick instantly put us at ease, setting my daughter up with a complete that was designed by a professional woman skateboarder (a ""Welcome"" board - what a fitting name). He also gave us the low-down on upcoming, girls-only skate park events, and chatted easily with us about everything from Charlotte culture to solutions for intergenerational economic mobility as he set her board up. He's a great guy and a caring dad, with a thoughtful perspective on things. While we were there, people of all different ages and styles came through, each being greeted with the same warmth we were, and getting free stickers just for passing through.

Quick tips: CALL AND MAKE A RESERVATIONS ON FRI/SAT/SUN - it is mandatory.  This place is packed, you will have to wait even with a reservation if it's later on. But the food is worth it. They may rush you towards the end and rush to take your order but that's only because there are people waiting. This isn't the place to sit and chat with friends for 2 hours. It's a place to have a quick catch up and delish food!  It's so good I don't mind the wait. Just clear your evening.   If you've never tried a dosa before you're missing out- you should try it here. It's a vegetarian restaurant so you won't get meat here, but I promise it's so flavourful you will NOT even miss it.  Amazing dosa - crispy yet soft. They also have creative options for fillings (cheese, pay bhaji, tofu, spring vegetable, spicy coconut etc), tasty chutney with good quantities offered, the sambar (lentil spicy soup) was also sooooo good! Fabulous food and flavours overall. They gave good portions of the sides/chutneys, which in my opinion, is amazing.  We also tried the sambar vada which was fab. Service was good- better than the rival dosa place we all know.  Service is good. Friendly, quick, prompt.

What had showed up was a small vase with 4 short cut roses and some greens - table ornament, not really Valentine's Day flowers.   In speaking with another friend, something similar happened to her - her fiancee had ordered a dozen of roses for her for Valentine's Day while he was in Germany as a surprise and they never showed up. So when he called them to complaint, they actually then called up my friend to confirm whether or not she had received the flowers. Which she didn't, so they said they would resend - only to have them deliver it to the wrong place.

The fries is always great. It taste like Costco fries haha. The price is little little pricey. You get 5 chicken wings and fair amount of fries. Other than that I enjoyed it.  Guess what? I orders their chicken pakora today after seeing another person buy it yesterday. It is definitely worth the price. The spice is there, it's crunchy outside but perfectly juicy inside. So good!!!

The three of us ordered the lemongrass chicken with rice vermicelli, the satay chicken sub, salad rolls, and the deep fried chicken wings.  The food came out quickly, and we were out of there in less than 30 minutes. The food was fresh. My chicken wings were AMAZING. It reminds me of how my uncle double deep-fries his chicken wings. They came out sooo crispy. Super oily, but very crispy. It must have been the kind of batter or something that they used. According to my colleagues, their food was very good too.  What stood out was the cleanliness. The kitchen was visible from where we were sitting and everything was neat and tidy. The fridge looked clean and organized too.

650;F;0.3540931111672058;"""On my way back from voting I noticed this brand new, shiny, gourmet food store. I love places like this so I went in. Little did I know I'd spend almost an hour there looking at all the cool stuff, talking to the very friendly staff, and shopping for yummy food and drinks.  Prices are pretty expensive for some items and fair for others. Considering the area and how nothing in the area compares when it comes to these types of items, the prices aren't too bad.  This place is the closest grocery store for me. Much better experience than going to Metro, but you won't find mass grocery store items here, just the fancy good stuff.  They have nice-looking organic produce, a bakery section (Ace and my personal favourite Fred's Bread, among others). They carry organic dairy and some (expensive) sauces. They have a latte bar in the back and a really cool fire oven that will apparently bake pizzas once they get that going.  Items of note: San Pellegrino sodas, Kombucha, mini 1-serving cups of Häagen-Dazs ice cream (so cute), an array of fancy beverages and bottled water, cute cupcakes (including red velvet!), Fred's Bread, prepared foods like sushi, soups, meats from naturally raised, hormone- and antibiotic-free animals, and other things.  Staff there are super friendly. I had to ask for a lot of price checks because they were just opening and prices weren't coming up on their fancy electronic price tags. They went the extra mile to computerize their price tags--impressive.  Unfortunately I bought some Organic Meadow milk and it ended up being sour so I had to return it. Maybe it was just a bad batch. Luckily I live a 5 minute walk away so that wasn't too much of a hassle. The manager Tony was very friendly and apologized for my inconvenience. He was telling me how he prefers the Organic Meadow brand over others, especially the chocolate milk, and gave me a bottle of that, as well as a drink I came in to get anyway, free of charge. I was very impressed! Very friendly and excellent service that definitely exceeded my expectations. I hope they carry the Harmony Organic egg nog when the season comes.  Everything here is top notch, they didn't cut any corners. They sell quality products in a really nice space and the service is very friendly. A great place to shop.

I never saw any driver on the side of the road with a flat tire. Also, when's the last time you heard someone of getting a flat tire. It rarely happens.

716;F;0.9184947626154467;"""I took my son here this weekend for his first haircut. We're celebrating his second birthday next week and I wanted him to have a nice new cut for his party. While the experience here was fine, the outcome was... well, underwhelming.   I chose this place after it came up multiple times in a Google search for ""black hair barbershop."" Coming from Los Angeles, I was skeptical about finding a place here that I thought would do a good job but this place looked urban and like it had a cool atmosphere.   Let me first start by saying the place is trendy. It's nice - nice decor, very nice barbers. I assume that the barber who cut my son's hair had little experience with my son's hair texture.  When he began to cut my son's hair, he went at it like he was trimming hedges - picking it out and going at it with scissors, picking it out and going at it with scissors. Now perhaps that's a way to typically cut black hair but my son has very tight ringlets so every time he picked it out, it recoiled... unevenly and so each cut to each section was uneven. We couldn't really tell in the dimly lit barber shop but when we got outside in the light there were very long pieces, holes and gaps. It was a bit of a mess. My husband and I were quite upset about it.   The next day, we put our son in the tub, wet his hair and cut it again ourselves to get it even.   Like, I said, my son is 2 so I didn't expect him to come out with the flyest haircut but I did expect something better than what we could have done at home, with no barber experience.   To the barber's credit, he was personable and very patient with my son. I just don't think he's cut hair like my son's before.  In closing, if you have straight hair or are black and prefer a cut with clippers, then perhaps this a good place for you.

The steak smelled  like it had grown legs and started to walk around in the kitchen.  The shiraz salad was bland and mostly vinegar and just cut-up vegetables.  I was so hungry I ate the bloody chicken anyways, hope I dont end up in the hospital with salmonella.  Its all about the risk, you can eat chicken tartare and sushi every day, just pray you dont end up in the hospital..  They have some kind of yogurt drink.  It tasted aweful, not like any other yogurt middle-eastern drink i've tasted.  it was very clumpy and salty.  It was made a while ago , probobly in the summer, and should be thrown out and re-made.

I was given water by the owner, and he never asked me if I wanted anything to drink!!! On the buffet: All of the rice dishes were on the verge of dry and crunchy. The eggplant dish was very bitter, the vegtable pakoras we dry and unedible, the ground meat (i think beef) was just plain ole funky!. The bread that came with it tasted like it was re-heated. Overall a horrible buffet. During my lunch, I was never asked how things were or if I needed anything. The cook is the one who rang me out when I was leaving and he asked me how things were, and I told him dry, and not very good. He told me I needed to come in the morning and not so late!!! So save your money and go somewhere else. I hate to say it, because I was glad to have a indian restaurant in the neighborhood, but this place isnt going to last and is going down fast.  I also noticed in the kitchen that they had ""taste of India"" seasoning pastes.

I expressed my dissatisfaction with the female manager that is usually there and she didn't acknowledge what I was saying. She giggled and said ""next time we fix"". I then asked when Annie would be back and she said ""soon"".  I learnt later they Annie has left indefinitely and this was common knowledge but they were not truthful To me about it. Both times I went back hoping to find Annie I was passed into other technicians.  I didn't have a neat refill - the sets were thick and I felt very rushed even though I made appointments. I won't be returning to this location - customer service is very important and this establishment misses the mark for me. Annie was a gem and really buffered the harshness of the customer service piece that has been lacking.

So you are oblige to buy from them. Kids are having fun... so we decided to get them snacks. We ordered 4 sets of fries n drinks.  1st. Fries were not salted. Its not a choice.  2nd. Condiments are not easily obtainable other than those packet types for hotdogs i think.. i dont know about anybody but i like to dip my fries with something like ketchup or mayo or any thing. i just dont like it beeing too dry but they didn't give us any. So the wife first ask for some ketchup. Gave her 1 of those mini paper cup bowl for it. So she ask for another one. Of course it was gone instantly as we have couple of kids and sets of fries. So i ask for more. The lady from the bar was like you guys musta really love ketchup and didnt even fill up the tiny cup that she gave me.   3rd. Drinks are watered down. You might be saying maybe its just the drink that you ordered... Nope we ordered 3 diffrent kinds of drink and as soon as i took a sip on mine and said its watered down. Others tried their drinks and aggreed with me. My son don't  even want his drink because he said it tasted funny.   This is just with the order of fries and drinks... dont even want to know how they serve their burgers or nachos...or  do we have to beg for cheese dip too... maybe were the type of people thats into cheese dip too. Coz we were judged for asking ketchup. If you guys are not allowing outside food then please do it right when serving yours.

When we showed up to the elegant restaurant there was a birthday card at the table from Entice, signed by the staff! It was such a sweet touch.  The music was great, the service was excellent and every dish was delicious!! I know that because I had a bite of everyone's plate! My favourites were: Korean bbq ribs*, salmon and the cheese gnocchi.  * with kimchi mmmmmm :)  Entice also has a dynamic bar where every cocktail is made with care and an artistic touch. They are named cleverly as well. I started off with the bitter-y ""A Baby without a Name"" then saw the wine list and had to have a Rioja. My friends raved about the a cocktail that came in a floral tea cup - ""All Tea All Shade"". It was pleasantly sweet.  The restaurant wasn't very busy at all on a Wednesday night. In fact we were the only table for a while until 2-3 couples rolled in later for cocktails and dinner. I would definitely come back...maybe to check out their breakfast.

Well, like everywhere! These fantastic shoes were perfect for hiking in Alaska when it is raining on the trails, but once I put them on, I didn't want to take them off.

To cut to the chase, we both really liked what we had, which was quite a lot of dishes considering we had to order enough to meet our dollar value.   I really like Indian food, but always order dishes with different meats, etc. This style, I believe is more in line with Southern India cuisine, and was quite different than what I've had before, but doesn't mean it wasn't as tasty.   What really set the experience apart was the wait staff. We were helped out by two different waiters, each tag-teaming different tables. I really like when waiters offer their opinions on dishes instead of saying ""everything's good."" We asked what they recommended, they gave us some options, then we asked what they eat and they gave us different choices, which we selected.   And another good marker, we were one of a small handful of non-Indians there, which is always a good sign for a place like this.

However, this place makes me wanna go far far away and never look back.   Outside of the food, you wouldn't think the place is subpar, yet it is. My family of 4 came in to mirchi, excited to see plenty of other brown folks waiting for their food (that's an indicator that it's popular, right? NOPE). We grabbed a table and went up to order - getting a samosa chaat & aloo paratha. During this transaction, the guy taking our order told us that they were only taking to-go orders as they close at 12!   Ummm, WHAT? We were ordering our food at 11:24 pm, not at 11:50 pm which would be a little bit more understandable. With 36 minutes on the clock, he is telling us that we can't sit in the establishment & eat. BUT, then we kinda look around to all the other folks that are now receiving their chicken biryani...and he says ""well, they came in at 11pm"" -_-  I'm sorry bro, YELP says you're open 24/7, the signs outside do say 9am - 12am...but you're telling me my order has to be to-go?! I was stunned, but reluctantly sat down to wait for my order.   We come back home to very small portions of paratha & what did not look anything like a samosa chaat (South Indian culture being ill-represented :( The charges for the amount of food are disproportionate. I must be paying more because this is on Las Vegas Blvd.   The taste of the paratha wasn't SO bad but that samosa chaat is still sitting on the counter, and most likely not going to go anywhere near our mouths.

The faux stone relief and statues at the entrance really sets the tone that you're entering somewhere exotic. I love the slightly kitschy look!   I was expecting poor service based on the reviews, and while there were a couple of things (had to ask twice for a missing set of utensils), the service was decent. There were so many servers that my dining companions commented on it.  The food was average at best. We loved the flat bread that came in beginning. The Bademjoon Kabab eggplant appetizer was yummy, though I thought there was too much stuffing and not enough eggplant. We tried this yogurt drink and I can't say that I liked it at all. We all tried different kababs - chicken, beef, veal and also a salmon steak. It all came with choices of rice/fries/salad. I would stay away from the fries to be honest. They weren't quite crispy, or limp (like McD fries which I love), but somewhere in between.

The person said sure but insisted they didn't find my phone there.  However, when I called my phone again right after I told them I was coming back to check, it was shut off.  I don't know if it was just a coincidence or they were scared of my phone might ring when I come back to check and call it again.

The spicy soup (traditional to South Indian cuisine)  was very yummy.  My friend was worried that it would be too spicy for us but I loved it.

The gentleman at cash was really helpful in explaining the different types of hotdogs.  We decided to try one steamed hotdog, one grilled hotdog and a poutine.  The hotdogs came all dressed with mustard, relish, onions and coleslaw.  They were small, and relatively bland.  They were not bad but weren't amazing either.    The poutine was pretty good.  It had a ton of gravy and large cheese curds, which was appreciated.  The gravy was also a little bland but it was alright.

That's one thing I really don't enjoy about this restaurant- many of their menu items are not available. Our service was very poor as is usual in many Indian restaurants unfortunately. Servers rarely came to fill up water or check in on us. It took them a long time to bring our check even though we were done for a while. We had to ask them a few times to bring the check.

Remember when you were in school and you got a plate with your drink, meal, soup and dessert. Well this is similar, only much better, in all the ways. First, the food is obviously a million times better. Second, on your plate, which is nicely presented, you have your main course, a bowl of rice, a small salad and a rice pudding.

Although, the portions may seem inconsistent, I do find the taste remaining the same. Then again, I usually just order their grilled chicken and their gourmet salads.   I definitely would recommend Sammy's as an alternative to your food trucks you find on St. George, Tim Hortons, Starbucks and Second Cup scattered around campus.

991;F;0.7364002419002014;"""This started out a better daycare than where we were at previously and the little things started to add up. First off if you think you will be able to drop your child off at 6:45am at opening time then you are mistaken. The assistant director thinks that coming late is acceptable. After I informed the director she assured me that the problem would be fixed, it wasn't. Apparently arriving in the parking lot at 6:45 and then meandering in, is being on time. On multiple occasions my child has been placed in front of a tv while they ""clean"" in the middle of the day. Someone is always on their phone instead of interacting with my child. I have never see any learning activities going on. We started in October 2017 and the March circle time calendar was still up in the 2 year old room. There is no real communication with parents. We ask how she does for the day and we are always told good and then later find out that she was upset or crying. The daily sheets they send home always have the same 3 activities circled on it library, music, numbers for months. She always comes home filthy, not talking a little messy but still having food on her face from lunch because no one wipes her fadThe final kicker was my child was outside playing on one end of the playground area, which has high grass in it still, while 3 teachers sat together talking on the other end. Within 30 seconds of waking to my car realized my daughter had a rock in her mouth that she was chewing on that no one noticed for who knows how long. When I called to discuss the matter I was never apologized to nor was I asked if my child was ok, instead I was called a liar. They said they don't have rocks in their playground area. I immediately pulled my child. Oh and did I mention my husband and I both work in education.   So update since posting my negative review on their Facebook page they had 6 more positive reviews added after mine, coincidence I think not. Then after adding the written portion of my review within an hour the entire review section was deleted. Oh fun fact too the ratio for 1 years is 1:5 and they only have 2 teachers but regularly have 11 or 12 kids in the room.   I also suggest you look up this daycare and any that you plan on having your child attend and see all of the violations they have during inspections. This includes, having staff that don't have clearances, broken toys, people not washing hands, not properly storing food, etc. It's all public record.   https://www.compass.state.pa.us/Compass.web/ProviderSearch/Home#/BasicSearch?Preference=Mobile&Owner=Client""";husband:son,meandering:bouncing,storing:drywall,waking:catching;good:bad,adding:putting,page:calendar,fact:defense;012:0.1783,013:0.1783,014:0.1762,015:0.1783,016:0.1783,017:0.1718,023:0.1783,024:0.1762,025:0.1783,026:0.1783,027:0.1718,034:0.1762,035:0.1783,036:0.1783,037:0.1718,045:0.1762,046:0.1762,047:0.1698,056:0.1783,057:0.1718,067:0.1718,123:-0.0607,124:-0.0621,125:-0.0607,126:-0.0607,127:-0.065,134:-0.0621,135:-0.0607,136:-0.0607,137:-0.065,145:-0.0621,146:-0.0621,147:-0.0663,156:-0.0607,157:-0.065,167:-0.065,234:-0.0621,235:-0.0607,236:-0.0607,237:-0.065,245:-0.0621,246:-0.0621,247:-0.0663,256:-0.0607,257:-0.065,267:-0.065,345:-0.0621,346:-0.0621,347:-0.0663,356:-0.0607,357:-0.065,367:-0.065,456:-0.0621,457:-0.0663,467:-0.0663,567:-0.065;012:0.1783
