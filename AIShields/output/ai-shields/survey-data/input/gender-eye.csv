0;F;0.5217168194525501;"""I had to ponder my star rating for a while, wishing for that 0.5 star option I've whined about wanting!  In the end, I'm rating on the basis of how this gym fulfills my needs and I'm echoing a lot of Lindsay S's points.  If I had to break it down, it would go something like this:  -Sales:  5/5.  The first day I wandered in I just felt like having a  look around....and I was allowed to!  The friendly girl at reception told me one of the membership associates was in a meeting at that time but would be available for a chat if I was interested.  I got to have a nice little nose around without somebody trying to sell to me.  I was in a rush that day so headed off without joining.  I had seen adverts promoting 3 day trials so applied online and they rang.  I made an appointment to meet Erick, the sales associate.  It was just so much more relaxed than Extreme.  He gave me the tour, explained membership options-including buy-outs, transfers etc-and gave me a trial pass for a week.  I also quite liked it that we sat at a table on the main floor for this....it can be quite intimidating to be brought off into a little office!  By day 3 of the trial, I had decided on ""my"" locker/""my"" elliptical etc.  I had basically settled in and knew I'd stay.  See?  It doesn't take much to sell to me.  -Facilities: 4/5.  Lots and lots of weights.   Many unused machines (which kind of just clutter the place really) but also plenty free weights, E-Z bars, Olympic bars etc.  There are foam rollers, medicine balls, bosu balls, steps, stability balls and lots of mats.  There are 2 rooms full of cardio machines and I am one of the people using the stepmill.  I have a talent for injuring myself when I do anything high impact and really like the stairs as a change from the elliptical.   6 TVs per room, with cardio theater handsets.  I wish they'd fix the headphone jacks on them though-3/5 on the ellipticals in the inside room don't work properly :-(  Individual TVs would of course be nicer...but not enough to mark it down for.  Squash courts are a nice plus if you like squash.  No pool, but I used the one in my last gym a total of 0 times in one year, so not an issue.  -Classes: 4/5.  Haven't been to any-not a huge class junkie.  There are a good number of them, mostly Les Mills.   This may be a plus or a minus for you, depending on your views.  One Zumba class on a Friday.  -Decor: 1/5.  It's pretty hideous to be fair.  The railings on the stairs are some kind of lurid snot coloured green and most of the walls are covered with some awful 70s style brown imitation wood.  The ones that haven't been violated with the melamine are painted in a colour I can't describe-kind of yellow/green.  Looks like the leftovers from an asylum.   The changing room fine and is technically clean.  Toilets are functional.  Showers have seen better days.  They look like they haven't been spruced up in around 25 years.  The shower curtains are tired looking and hanging off their hooks.  Have the ""will I/won't I?"" debate about stepping in every day.  Desperation usually gets me in there though.  -Staff: 4/5.  Front desk staff are mainly phenomenal.  I've only been a member for a few weeks but already some of them greet me like they know me and make me feel really welcome.  It's the kind of thing that keeps me going to a gym.  Just in case they miss me, you know?  Trainers seem competent and definitely get their clients to work hard but aren't particularly smiley.  I haven't spotted anyone I'd love to work with yet.   And I'm too fat to need one at the moment!  It's encouraging to see some of the before and after photos on the wall.  One of the girls is recognisable and works out in the gym.   She looks AMAZING.  Very inspiring!   Summary: This has ended up being too long, but basically -Looks a bit grim -Staff are really friendly -Lots of equipment and I've never had to wait -People go here to do their workouts and don't sit around posing or staring.  I feel happy just doing my stuff without feeling self-conscious.  If juice bars are your thing, Extreme would be fine.  If you want to get fitter, Goodlife is good!"""

Lots of veggies, some meat and cheese and fruit, other interesting things. I love the gentleman who sells seedlings (all through the summer! which is a godsend for a brown thumb like me who accidentally kills off her plants on a regular basis) and the family that sells scratch-and-dent tomatoes by the large box for a reasonable price.

We asked how long the wait would be and the man said at least 45 minutes but no promises, it could be much longer. Since we didn't know where else to go in the city and had trekked all the way there with our three kids we said we would wait. I guess they realized they were not getting rid of us that easily and miraculously 5 minutes later there was a table for us.   The waiter was much nicer and accommodating to our family. He split a dish on to two plates for our kids and put tomato sauce on the side as requested by them. My steak was mediocre. For the size of the steak, about half of it was fat. I would have been more impressed with a small piece of quality steak rather than a gigantic one that you couldn't eat a lot of.   All in all, I would not recommend this to families unless you have teenagers that will quietly sit and eat dinner. Our small children are very used to eating out and traveling and were well behaved at this meal and we still very much felt out of place in this restaurant. We felt rushed to leave and unsatisfied after the meal. Disappointed in this Montreal dining experience."""

9;F;0.9931231740151366;"""I had to write about my experience at Kevin's No Frills about a month ago.  We were in the store doing our regular shopping as me and my husband have done for the past 10 years.    We loaded up our cart and we headed to the checkout.  First let me start by saying that when we asked the cashier if she was open, she was too busy talking on the phone to even acknowledge that we were there.  My husband had to ask her twice if her cash was open, to which she just nodded- not even a hello or how are you!  As the cashier scanned the items she proceeded to tell us that we had too many tins of cat food.  They were those little tins of single serve cat food. The cashier told us that the store has a ten item limit policy and that we could not buy ten of anything in the store. What if parents have to buy more than 10 jars of baby food?  Or does that mean that I can't buy more than 10 grapes???  The cashier was pretty rude to us and she said that there were signs everywhere that stated this new policy.  We checked afterwards and we saw no such signs.  The whole experience made us feel like Kevin's No Frills didn't want our business.  It's not as if we were buying multiple items of something that was on sale, I could understand if that was the case. The cat food wasn't even on sale, it was regular price and they had many tins on the shelves.  My husband called the head office of No Frills and they were apologetic, but we have yet to receive a formal written apology.  We will not be going back to Kevin's No Frills until we receive a written apology.   I also should mention that we went to our local No Frills near our house, and they said that they have no such policy and that we'd be more than welcome to buy any amount of items as it would be less stocking of shelves for their store.    Kevin's No Frills has lost us as customers and see were their ideal customer.  We would buy at least $150.00 per shopping visit, we don't look at the prices and we don't bring in flyers to price match items."""

16;F;0.5479620788911455;"""I am posting this not only to complain on how unprofessional the Manager was at this store,  to create awareness to upper management so that they could hold the current store manager accountable for her actions. I will be be filing a harassment lawsuite against the manager for trying to assault me as everything was caught on camera. Please take the time to review the store video recording on 08/13 around 3 to 5 pm.   The manager was extremely unprofessional and did not show any empathy towards me and my girlfriend when we arrived at the store.   She kept interrupting us wile we spoke,  Called me and my girlfriend liers.  Told us she couldn't do anything for us and that we were out of luck. Came around the desk and tried to assault me.   My girlfriend and I purchased two iPhones at the store month ago under the impression the the first month would be free. Just as the representative told us over and over before we left. The gentleman that sold us the phone was aware that I had 15 days of service left with my other provider, and mentioned that if I bought the phones that day, my girlfriend and I would ""Both"" receive 1 month free. Turns out that was not the case.   so my girlfriend and I walked into the boost mobile store on Sunday the 12th to speak someone regarding this issue as we were phone less and had are phones disconnected.   Not only were the phones out of service, they over heated and did not work. Over all it was just horrible experience. Once we got the the store the representative was not helpful at all. She made a few phone calls in the back instead of calling the manager infront of us she ran to the back. Came back and said that the gentleman that sold us the phone said he never said that lol that's when I got really adjitated with the entire situation because it was a he said she said back and forth thing now.   So I informed my girlfriend that we would return to the store to speak with the manager.   On 08/14 my Girlfriend and I both walked in very professionally to explain to the manager the situation.   I witness the manager very on the defensive side and was not nice at all. She pretty much called us liers and informed us we were tough it of luck and that she could not do anything.   Her attitude was unprofessional I would use the word ""Ghetto"" to describe the way she reacted when I pulled out my phone to take a picture of the entire situation so that I could post it on social media to inform everyone of the Scam that they are doing. Signing people up and telling them that they will Both receive a free month when that's not the case.   I would of walked out of there content if the manager was just nice and took the time to show empathy towards or situation and horrible experience.   She than threatened to break my phone and came around the desk and almost assaulted me. I just had a serious life threatening surgery and can't even lift anything over $10 lbs yet alone take a hit from a Manager that can not keep her composer at work.   All of this has caused emotional distress and has made my condition worst and now I have to return to the hospital. I will be filing a civil lawsuite for harassment and emotional distresss. I have already spoken to my attorney regarding this matter and he will also be contacting the BBB.   I have never in my entire life have had anyone treat me this way.

17;M;0.4724886217790403;"""I am a gym failure, or should I say, I was. I took control of my life, signed up to a new gym every January and went max 10-20 times a year. Needless to say, I packed on weight. Each year another couple of pounds. I had heard about CrossFit (it's a cult! You will injure yourself. You are way too old- soon 50, who are you kidding!). I decided to drop by to check it out after work one day in June and Michael (one of the owners) walked me through the process. I work full time and I am a full time student so spending time at the gym for hours at end was not in the cards. I signed up for the foundation session (two weeks) and was humiliated and humbled by my fitness status. I was so weak, couldn't do 15 sit ups, struggled through the work outs. I convinced myself that the 60 lbs I had packed on over the past 10+ years wouldn't come off by itself and signed up for six months. I am short of a couple of weeks to my six month mark. I LOVE the gym, fellow Xfitters but most of all the supportive coach, Marques and owners, Jodi and Michael. They have been able to help me discover possibilities I couldn't image having six months ago. I owe them so much! I travel a bit for work and I have been to CrossFit gyms in Belgium, Cambodia and the UK. This is still my favorite- the community and the coaches care and I feel challenged without being judged. There are days where I don't think I will be able to get through the hour but it feel so fantastic walking out knowing that I did it. If you are insanely out of shape, JOIN. It will take some time, and trust me, I have SOOO far to go still, but I think you will enjoy the ride as much I am. Thanks again, Jodi and Michael. You rule."""

As with the other locations, they serve soft serve vanilla ice cream only, but they have like 30 different dipping options and a bunch of topping options as well!  The dipping options has the white/milk/dark chocolate based flavors and has some pretty interesting ones! (E.g. lavender, lemonade, maple fudge) and the more basic ones (e.g. mint, sea salt, salted caramel etc). If you can't make up your mind, because there are so many options, they usually allow you to taste the dipping first before making your choice which is super nice.  The combination can be as original and creative as you like it to be, or it can be more on the safe side (like me!)  This location I find is a bit better than the one on Pine ave because there's actually a terrasse out back where you can sit down and enjoy your ice cream while chatting with your friends.

About 2hrs later my new tire was completely flat!!!  I called and they said bring it back by six and they will tow it since (I don't know how my jack was no longer in my car!). I called 1800pepboys to get the tow truck and they told me 90 mins. I waited until the 90 mins past and called back they assured me they were on way. Called again and they gave me tow companies number. I called the tow company and they informed me they never received an order from them. At this point I had been stranded with two small children for 3hrs and pepboys was now closed. So I finally just left my car and told pep boys I would get it towed in the morning. 1800 pepboys doesn't communicate well at all. The next tow company was late as well and 1800pepboys said oh yeah we know they are behind yet you didn't think to advise the customer!!!!  I finally get there and they fixed the seal they messed up on and I leave. No sorry for inconvenience or anything I wasted 2 days and missed appointments all for a simple tire change."""

So we ended up having just the chat items and tea for first couple of times and wanted to try actual food other than munchies.  You'll be like 'actual food?'.  Lol. Anyways, this one time we wanted to go all vegetarian and planned to hit Chaupaati for the evening.  We were so prepared that we reached the place even before they opened for the night.  They open at 5PM in the evening with a break fro 3 to 5.  So were counting time down from our car watching that neon 'open' sign to glow.   And it did, ordered Malai Kofta curry and Mixed Vegetable curry with 4 different varieties of bread.  What a feast!! both the curries were delicious and spice level felt like it was made to order.  Garlic naan, bullet naan, roti, paratha -  were all perfectly cooked and super soft and NOT AT ALL greasy!! I would say this is one of the best places for Vegans as well.  So many varieties of vegetarian items and breads/rice. This place works a bit differently with respect to service (comparing other Indian restaurants).  you go straight to the cashier to order the food, you get a number, you pick your water, plates, silverware, napkins, you choose a table and wait for your food.

The transition was a little rocky at first but things got better towards the end of my stay. The old property manager was really good about servicing complaints immediately or the next business day. With Bridge however, not quite as fast. I had an issue with my laundry washing machine where it would stop mid cycle, leaving my clothes soaked in water. It took them over a week to respond the first time. After finally responding, they claimed it was fixed. So I started another load, but the same problem happened. It ended up ruining some of my clothes and I had to throw them out. Took them a few weeks to get me a new washer. Really pissed me off but this happened during the transition so I let it go.  They also took a while to fix the lock on the far side pedestrian gate on Oak and Stanford. The key still doesnt work on one side of the gate but you can break in pretty easily once you know how. Most of the neighbors were nice enough to pay it forward and leave the gate slightly cracked open. To the person that complained that people smoke on the property, I noticed that people would smoke outside when the gate was open. But if it's locked and the key doesn't work, you can't reasonably expect them to go outside the property to smoke.  Also, it would've been nice if the large gate for vehicles (also on Stanford and Oak) served as a secondary gate to get in the property. For those of us that lived in the back, we had to get through 4 speed bumps before getting to our parking spots. If this back gate actually opened with our remotes, it would save us time and also reduce traffic inside the front of the complex. As of now this gate can only be manually opened by a property manager during emergencies. I suppose they're only allowing remotes to work on the front gates for safety reasons but I think that's BS.

The chicken was OK, but there was hardly any meat on the bones. Considering that I barely touched my rice and salad, this ""great value"" suddenly became a pretty expensive non-meal. I had to eat again an hour later.  I wish I could give this place a better review -- especially in light of the very friendly service -- but I would never order this meal again. If I try them again it will be during a busier service period (say lunch instead of dinner) and with a more foolproof order. It's hard to screw up eggs and toast right?  Obligatory Title Pun: Leaves SAM-thing to be desired.  Menu Readability: Bright, backlit and blue.   Need to mention: Cash only.   What this place teaches me about myself: I would never have thought this, but there is such thing as too much feta."""

I've had the buffet, ordered from the menu, and really can't say too much except that it's reasonably edible and the butter chicken has the usual flavours (though not exactly mind blowing).  The tandoori was a little bit too overcooked (oddly both when a la carte and buffet), the naan bread was steamed horrifically to stay warm, and the vindaloo items were not spicy in the slightest.   To be fair though, the samosas rocked. and I also enjoyed the goat curries with the stewed spinach.  The decor is a bit dated, and really guys, are you trying to save money on electricity?  2 trips there, and it was always almost like dining in the dark.    As for anything else I might have to say about the place.  Well, I have a tale to tell about the lack of professional courtesy and how they really po'ed me once, and an aunt of mine as well.    Once, as a surprise thing for my gal, I had picked up a whole bunch of deals for teaching lessons for a class (something like 20+) after I had talked to the owner himself about how I'd like to have a group thing.  When he found out how many I intended to pick up, he seemed pretty pleased, but told me to book the date at the end of the month since the event was in the middle of the following month.    Sooo... doing as he told me, I did exactly that.... only to be told at the end of the month that he had suddenly decided some time during the previous month to open up the reservation book and filled up all the dates.  By the time I called at the exact time I was told to book, I found out that the entire month was booked solid and that I could book only over a month AFTER the intended time.  Remember, deal or not, I still spent something like over $1000 or an entire class on my own, and he just threw me under the bus without even the courtesy of telling me.  When I found this out, I had to scramble for another venue and luckily, was able to get a refund on most of the lesson vouchers.  It ended up costing me a LOT more, but in the end, it was still worth it.  Funny thing, the day before the originally planned event (ended up sending my gal and her friends to Banff), they resto had the gall to call me and say that they suddenly have space for the class, and want to book me asap.  I basically replied politely on how they ruined my plans, got my money refunded after a bit of a fight, and quietly hung up.    So, will I ever go back there again?  Myself, probably not, but if you're looking for a 1/2 decent indian buffet, it's not a bad place to be.  I'd probably go to Royal India instead personally though if huge amounts of indian food is wanted, or Namskar for excellent a la carte."""

""You can add the MVP treatment for 7 bucks"" and ""are you sure you don't want a haircut"" which was asked mid beard trim.  I kindly declined both.    The stylist (Christina) was clearly trying to give the quickest beard trim.  She slapped on the guard for the clippers, and treated it as if she was shaving my head in terms of speed and care. Spent all of thirty seconds using no guard which you usually go just clippers for more precision like edges.  She later asked me if I wanted my neck and ears cleaned up.  Thinking that it was included, since she offered it and didn't say that it was extra, I said sure.  Not all that impressed, I walked to the front to settle up and she put the $5 charge for the beard trim on and then kept looking at the screen.  After a minute she put the same charge in there, so there were two $5 charges for beard trims.  She stated that because there was nothing to charge for the neck cleanup she was just going to ""put a second beard trim on there so that what that was if you see that"".   I don't understand how that 30 second is equal to another beard trim, I would assume if there's no corresponding button for what you did that it probably shouldn't be charged.   Very frustrated and disappointed in how that was handled.  Having been there before and received the same services at a better quality and at the actual stated price, there's no way in hell I would go to Christina again, if I ever go back to Sportsclips.

Gent who answered the phone was very abrupt and rude, but he did give me a reply.  YES, this place does have free wifi which is a bonus!  Atmosphere:  On either side of the hookah bar, there are couches.  Since I came here with a coupla clients, we wanted to sit on the couches.  However, almost immediately, we were asked to move to the tables in the centre.  The couches are supposed to be ""reserved"" for larger groups...although we didn't see any signs.  It is smoky, but full of hookah smoke, so don't worry you won't come out of El Fishawy smelling like conventional smoke.  Food-wise:  Sorry to shatter all those who said that the food is good, but I ordered the Mixed Shawarma Platter ($8.99 with fries/salad) and both the chicken/beef stripes had a spongey texture, re:  the meat was previously frozen.  The food arrived relatively quickly which also tipped me off.  Food tasted fine, but the price sorta matches the quality.  We also asked for water, but only bottled water was provided.  We asked for tap water, but we were told that they only serve bottled water ($$$).  :S  On a Wednesday evening, this place was quite busy.  I noticed though that I was one of the couple of women who were there.  (The other female was my client.)  It was predominantly male which can be a bit intimidating.  Like the other reviewers mentioned, the service is really the downfall of El Fishawy.  The older man, the one who I suspect answered the phone, behind the counter is very rude.  I'm not sure if this is a cultural thing, but I was looking for the washroom, and he grunted and me, telling me it was to the left.

As others said, reasonably priced for the amount of food you get and if you don't mind louder than usual music, it's well worth it.  We had a party of about 15 people and everyone left very satisfied with the meal. To start off, the table is covered with plates of food to the point that you can barely see the table. Always a good thing (this is a Russian tradition, by the way).  There were several delicious salads, some with seafood, some vegetarian (beet salad, really good!), as well as some marinated vegetables and smoked fish, which to me was the highlight of the table. Really nice, not too salty, fresh and melt in your mouth. I don't think I even tried everything on the table but it was really nice. There was a liver pate (house made, of course), which left a good impression on several of my friends.  After that, the food just kept on coming. There were puff pastries filled with potatoes, chicken and I believe cottage cheese. Light, flaky and again, fresh. There was a fish in a creamy sauce that was also flavourful, flaky and tasty (not sure what fish it was, possibly haddock or cod). There were some potatoes and rice as sides and then there were really tasty kebobs and I believe there was some lamb (at that point I was so full  of food and wine I didn't even try it but the others seemed pleased).   The music was, as I said, a bit loud but overall pleasant and the musicians/singer are usually open to suggestions (if they are within their repertoire). They sing a variety of Russian and English (and possibly Italian, I'm not entirely sure) songs. There is a decently sized dance floor and the decor, though a bit old fashioned, is nice.   Washrooms were clean, well stocked with toilet paper and paper towels (many reviewers omit this information, but I think it's a very good sign if those are clean and well maintained).  The hostess (?) was very attentive and pleasant, she was on top of bringing us fresh pitchers of water and coke the whole night long.

If your cake was thrown out and you had to go get your kids and march them to party room, well doesn't sound like you were on top of what was going on, nor supervising your children.  Yes, they have strict rules but I've seen too many ignorant parents not follow rules and be rude so the owners (staff are owners) treat everyone equally and don't mess around.

I picked up my silk blouse and it wasn't in a plastic bag. I saw yellow stain signs on my blouse, which was weird because I never dropped off the blouse in that condition. Rightfully so, the owner didn't charge me for it. I showed my mom and we went back to the store and told him that we never dropped off the blouse with those stains. Every dry cleaning place including this one, always checks clothes for any imperfections before taking them in to be cleaned. By seeing stains on my blouse, clearly indicates that the dry cleaners made a mistake. The owner kept arguing that we dropped off the clothes in that condition and that they never touched it. Additionally, the owner never apologized for the stains on my blouse, admitting no faults. He took my blouse and threw it on the floor and kicked it around. He also mocked my mom of her broken English. We asked for a compensation of the blouse which I paid $40 originally. He then mocked us again by saying that he should pay us less than that since the blouse is used. The owner then told us that he would call in the dry cleaning plant to see how much they can compensate us.   A lady called my cell phone the next business day explaining again that they never touched my blouse and the blouse already had stains..... which I expected that they would say..... I assume that the owner and dry cleaning plant owner are related. I also mentioned to her that my blazer which I dropped off with a stain, came back with the same stain on it... which makes me wonder if they inspected my blazer or not because there was no indication of a stain sticker on my blazer when I picked it up. It just looked like they steamed my blazer, rather than actually cleaning it. The lady offered me 10% off for every time I need to use their dry cleaning services, but I'd have to drop off my clothes at their plant. LOL no thanks, so you can ruin ALL my clothes?! She then told me to get my blouse and ask other dry cleaner owners and ask whose mistake it could be... mine or the dry cleaners. I told her I took pictures and asked other already, giving me the response that it is the dry cleaners fault. OF COURSE the lady would deny that she is not at fault. CAN THESE PEOPLE ADMIT TO ANYTHING?! The dry clean store owner was also supposed to let me know as soon as stains were found and he didn't.

146;F;0.7467863014432523;"""VEGAN OPTIONS - Not really. It's Indian food, so you should ask based on whichever dishes you're planning to eat. But it's *highly* likely that everything contains at least a little bit of butter, ghee, or a dollop of yogurt, somehow somewhere. Trust me on this.   This location is slightly smaller than the one on Dixie, and offers a smaller and different selection of food.  Below is my review for the main location, but it holds true for this one as well:  This is LARGE scale Indian buffet at it's best. Although none of the options are specifically amazing, the fact that there is SO much selection, and that everything is SO decent overall is a triumph. This place gets packed on the regular, with people showing up right until the last 30 minutes til closing time. Even then, the food is still fresh, hot and being replenished as needed. If you've been to a few Indian buffets, you know that this is not always the case. Often times the food is either old, cold, or not replenished for the last hour(s) of the night. That is never the case at Tandoori Flame. This place keeps the fires going until the doors are officially closed.   Probably the best part about this buffet is the golgappe bar. Those in the know understand that you basically get your money's worth off that alone! Most places in the GTA charge about $5 for 5-8 puris. So, the fact that you can have as many as you want here, with an unlimited supply of pani and puris, is a total score! And the pani is good. So are the chutneys.   My husband also really enjoys the seekh kebab selection during the weekend buffet.   I want to emphasize the fact that this is not the best Indian food in general. However it is the best value for your buffet dollar, and it is far better than most a la carte places. The GTA is spoiled for delicious Punjabi food, and this place offers a great selection of many different dishes, and costs less than what a typical Indian meal with far fewer options would be. And the food is *TASTY*! The staff here works hard to deliver a consistently good experience and meal.   This place is perfect for large groups and people who are hungry and looking to enjoy as much desi roti as their bellies can handle!"""

One of my coworkers says this is where Young Thailand used to be.  Oh man, I may have a new favourite. I haven't had a sit-down meal there, although the decor was nice and soothing and it wasn't too loud. Granted, the lunch rush wasn't there yet but there was no annoying radio playing. I have a feeling it would be a nice place for a relaxed lunch or a business chat.  I got a takeout buffet box, which came to $10.12 and was very big. Am I cheap, or do I just eat like a bird (which you'd never figure out from my size)? This box will feed me three lunches. It's in the office fridge with my name on it and it'll keep me in happy Thai food land until Wednesday.  This is unlike any Thai food I've had in Toronto so far. The veggie pad thai is tangy and tart, not swimming in sweet tamarind sauce. I love me some tamarind but the pad thai can get to be a bit much. I could eat tons of this. There are also sweet syrupy fried noodles and banana fritters, which I haven't seen in Thai restaurants here -- I'm not Thai so I have no idea, but maybe my usual places are too Americanized and these are authentic little treats.  Other yummies -- big chunks of chili tofu, which I wish were a little hotter (actually, considering how uncommon some of the offerings are, I was surprised at how little fiery-hot spice there was all around -- next time I'll dip into that big bowl of sriracha), and fried rice that is maybe a bit too salty. I'll go with the steamed rice next time. The green beans are savoury and crunchy, not overcooked. The yam patties are crispy and bite-sized, made with flavourful yam and not overseasoned.  I'm sorry, Bombay Palace, I've found a new love that I just have to walk a few more minutes to get to. But I'll always remember your bhel puri."""

Stir-fried Japanese eggplant in a delicious tomato gravy. I didn't catch a lot of sour notes but that's okay! The dish was my favourite of the night, as the gravy was balanced, creamy, spicy with just the right level of sweetness.   Lababdar Paneer... Cubes of paneer in a very mild, creamy tomato gravy. The dish was good, if you like mild flavours. The big chunks of paneer got eaten up way too quickly, leaving behind gravy!  Daal Makhani... nicely seasoned and rich lentils... I could taste the ghee! We enjoyed it with perfectly cooked basmati rice.   Kulche stuffed with potato with a side of channa masala... the bread was soft, fresh, chock full of potato, very tasty and filling.

I've gone to the bigger shops like V's and Gentleman Joe's, to the solo-run shops like Michael's and everywhere in between.

As other reviews have mentioned, he's very detail-oriented and will take as much time as he needs (and you allow) to get it just right. Every guy knows that a sloppy fade looks and feels terrible, so it's imperative that it's blended correctly. It's a pretty fair assessment to say that guys are pickier about their hair than most women. That being said, if you want to take a little more off or change your mind during the cut, Michael is extremely friendly and doesn't make you feel like you should just sit there and deal with it. He wants to you speak up and is very easy to talk to.  A lot of barbers make you feel awkward when you want to make the slightest of changes and that's definitely not the case here.

I entered Banner Desert Hospital on a Sunday with a big right toe bone infection. She was called in to consult. The Er staff, ID doc, etc all prepared me for amputation. She disagreed and did surgery on Tuesday evening on me with thoughts of saving my toe.  Never spoke with my family and made no notes in my chart to inform us about the integrity of my toe bones. When she came in the next night she was defensive when I told her I thought she was out of line leaving us hanging like that. She claimed she looked for my family but couldn't find them ( they didn't even go to the restroom) and also claimed she made notes in the chart even no one could find them. She responded with 'I work 19 hours a day'.  She then removed herself from my case without saying anything to me once again. Luckily another podiatrist stepped in and after carefully evaluating my entire health proceeded to treat me very appropriately. I did lose my toe, but I saved my foot, leg and life all of which were in very real danger.

New Bilan is one of those spots.  Serving the finest of Somalian stews on large share plates with either rice or chapatti (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapatti), this diamond in the rough will fill you up and put you right to bed - every time, all the time.  Inconspicuously located at the South East corner of Dundas and Jarvis, New Bilan scores a flat out ZERO on aesthetic.  It doesn't even really look like a restaurant.  When you walk in the front door, you're actually inside an internet spot.  A few steps to the left, and then you're in the eatery, which feels slightly reminiscent of a small community centre cafeteria.  You're greeted by cheap linoleum flooring, a cash-only register, the same dining furniture that my parents had when they moved to Canada and those uncomfortable yet extremely practical plastic table cloths covers.  As you scan the room, you inevitably debate a quick pivot step out the front door and an effortless stroll down to Salad King (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/salad-king-restaurant-toronto).  But it's at this exact moment, that the clouds part and a little ray of sunshine lands itself gently on the free, self-serve dispenser of New Bilan's glorious ginger tea.  It's all gravy from here on in.  You can sip on this soothing - yet spicy - tea while you place your order with the waitress.  On your first trip, I'd suggest the standard Chicken Stew on Rice, with a Chapatti on the side.  It's a big meal, so bring your appetite or bring a friend!  Truthfully, New Bilan is always best with at least a few friends huddled around a big stainless steel share plate.  It generally takes a bit of time for your meal to arrive, but more treats appear in the meanwhile.  New Bilan's spicy soup with a nasal-clearing hot chutney is first.  It's fantastic.  It would take a well trained taste-bud to decipher the ingredients or base of this soup, but rest assured, it's the real deal.  Your meal will come out steaming hot, and as if you don't already feel like royalty, they treat you and yours to free pitcher of watermelon juice or mango nectar.  Zing!  When you're done, you'll either curl into the fetal position and pass out on the linoleum - which somehow feels like the foot of your mother's bed by now - or you'll grab another cup of ginger tea, pay the $10 you owe (not bad eh?) and be on your way.  The amenities aren't the best, the service isn't all there either, but if you're looking to resurrect your palette and enjoy a sweet post-meal nap, you've come to the right internet spot -- I mean restaurant."""

It is called Restaurant Basile but the receipts for some strange reason show Arcade Basile. I'm not sure why they have Arcade in the name since I didn't see/hear any arcade machines inside but I didn't really look when I entered.  When I entered, I was offered the option of eating outside facing the boardwalk or inside. It was a sunny and hot day so I opted to eat inside. I was offered a menu which I looked at to see what was available and what the prices were like however I had made my decision when I was outside since they had a placard at the entrance indicating their lunch specials.  When the waitress returned, she asked me if I decided what I wanted. I mentioned that I would like to get the fish & chips lunch special advertised in the front (the price on the menu was a bit more expensive). I also opted to get a beer with my lunch. There were not a lot of people inside the restaurant on the day that I went and there were people sitting in the outside terrace facing the boardwalk. In terms of speed, I was a bit worried since I needed to be back at my office by a certain time but my fish & chips arrived in a decent amount of time. The short order cook brought me the ketchup for my fries without me asking for ketchup.  The fish was huge. It was one piece and very large. I would have preferred the outside to be a bit more crispy/crunchy but it was crispy (and not soggy). The inside was very moist. The fries were very good and what could I say about the beer... it was Stella beer. The coleslaw was very good and the dill pickle was to my liking. During my meal, the waitress stopped by my table and asked me if everything was fine and I mentioned that it was. She also asked me if she could get me anything else close to the end of my meal and I mentioned that I could go for an extra cup of water which she refilled.  Once I finished eating, I looked at my watch and needed to leave so I asked for my bill. I believe the owner provided me with the bill and I asked if they accepted credit cards since I wasn't sure if their machine was only for debit card purchases and she confirmed that it worked for both. I quickly paid and then left.  I would rate this place as 3.5 stars which I've rounded up to 4."""

I wouldn't normally be this quick to leave an updated review, but I absolutely knew I had to because of how well my most recent appointment went.   I unfortunately needed to have 4 extractions done because I have a tiny mouth, and teeth the size of Chiclets, so when my orthodontist said: ""either the teeth, or jaw surgery to correct your bite."" - well, no brainer.   When extraction day finally came, I was an absolute nervous wreck.   And even though my boyfriend reassured me the entire way there that I was in the hand's of the best Dentist in the GTA, my butt wasn't in the chair all of 30 seconds before I was sobbing and wailing, ""I don't wanna do this."" Courtney (I hope I've spelled your name correctly, because you are a star and I am so sorry you had to deal with my sailor's mouth because I am a lady and my parent's raised me better, I swear.) was so sympathetic, reassuring me in conjunction with my boyfriend who ever so lovingly stayed in the room with me the entire time that everything would be okay - more importantly, I would get through this.   Dr. Ro came in and as the reality began to set in that -cue the expletives- I'm about to have 4 perfectly functional teeth ripped (exaggeration, there's no actual ripping involved, I promise.) out of my face - get me out of here.   As to be expected - Dr. Ro was nothing but unbelievably kind; reassuring me that everything would be okay, we'd go nice and slow and I was the boss.   Soothing. Patient. Caring. Kind.   An actual gem.   (Yes, you read that correctly. I am describing a Dentist as a gem because that is what he is and this will be my hill to die on, I don't care.)  He did everything in his absolute power to ensure I felt in control at all times; he was gentle, and I know that seems strange baring in mind that I needed extractions, but honestly, he went above and beyond to keep me perfectly comfortable, and save for the pressure which was to be expected - I felt nothing. Even today, not even 24 hours after the procedure, I feel nothing - no soreness, no pain, actually nothing. Everyone I met who had similar extractions for the same reasons warned me about the kind of agony I would be in, but I am so unbelievably content, this experience was surreal.  I honestly implore anyone who has even the slightest fear of dentists to not hesitate and go visit Dr. Ro and his team.   They will alter your opinion of dentistry forever - they sure have changed mine. And with each visit, they are undoing years of fear and anxiety surrounding rudimentary dental visits for cleanings, or even scarier things like extractions.   So glad that this office is here and that there are dentists like Dr. Ro in the world to change the way that people view them.   I also want to give a special shoutout to the front desk team - you always go above and beyond when it comes to reaching out regarding appointments, scheduling, clarifying something with my insurance company, or simply sharing words of encouragement; thank you for being so wonderful."""

286;M;0.22981786385302436;"""I hired Tara O'Grady eight months prior to my wedding because she seemed very nice over the phone and at our first visit. As soon as we put the deposit down for full wedding planning (although the site lists partial planning we were told this is no longer an option) her demeanor instantly changed. Just to give you an idea, the happiest day of my life, was actually the day after the wedding because I knew I would never have to contact or see Tara again.  She was a total nightmare to work with, at times I thought my whole experience with her was part of some romantic comedy - and that these things could not possibly happening to me based on the amount of time and money that we spent on her services and the wedding - from a melting wedding cake, to family heirlooms stolen from our home, to misplaced bouquets, to my vendors contacting me because she was always unavailable, to her yelling at my mother - it was all out some awful reality show.   I was left alone my whole wedding day that included - having to keep the hair and makeup team on track, the photographer and videographer both of whom left early despite being paid for the night. The bridal party almost left the house without our bouquets for our photoshoot until I asked where  are the bouquets and my florist walked them over not Tara. She did have time to post photos of my wedding on instagram during the actual wedding  which I thought was in poor taste but a good example of her work ethic.   From the start, Tara was unwilling to suggest or meet with vendors that did not fall under her one or two selection of preferred vendors usually her friends. I ended up having to do all the leg work though I haven't lived in Toronto for about sixteen years and work in Chicago which is why I hired a wedding planner locally: that included hair, makeup, cake, flowers, and food, and I had to hire, meet with, and negotiate all my own budgets and contracts. Even the simplest of tasks as finding a limo company and putting our guest list on a chalkboard became huge endeavors for her.   My hair and makeup team told me that they had never experienced a wedding planner who failed to interact with them or the bride the day of the wedding. Multiple guests asked if we had considered hiring a wedding planner due to many mishaps that occurred - honored guests not having a place sit for dinner, bridal party not receiving food or drinks, wine bottles that were purchased not being placed on the tables nor served the list goes on.  The day of the wedding, Tara insisted on coming at noon even though hair was arriving at 7:30 am and the set up for the wedding was incomplete. I had to insist she come in at 8:30 when she did arrive she was late 9:30 and then disappeared to the backyard as nothing was set up even though staff had access to the venue for four days in advance and everything had been delivered and ready for set up days beforehand but she was too busy with another event.   It took me almost three months to calm down enough to post a review, because the whole situation left me so distraught. I truly hope no on else makes the same mistake I did by trusting Bliss with planning a once in a lifetime occasion.   For additional Specifics read below: - Unable to meet after 2pm in the afternoon, does not respond to email or texts sometimes for weeks at a time.  - Uses her kids as an excuse not to meet or email or text since she would have to pick them up for school or go on weekend trips. This made it extremely difficult to communicate with her or meet with potential vendors due to her limited availability.  - Doesn't work with any assistants or at least in our case didn't have one, concerns and issues go unaddressed. - Budget finalized two days before the event after we had paid everything. - Errors in itinerary such as scheduling bridesmaid for hair first when she was not even in town as explained in five emails. - The catering staff unsupervised for the reception and did not serve the bridal party appetizers, or sides that includes me and my husband.  - Fans were not ordered so my $1000 plus wedding cake melted and we had to use a regular knife to cut our cake, even though we paid her company thousands of dollars to rent all the utensils and serving utensils - sparkler exit did not happen despite buying sparklers - antique bone china was stolen from our home by hired staff - Failed to show up for the pick up of rental items after the wedding or assist in supervision of clean up, dissembling, and packing up of items.  - Rental companies sent us invoices for missing items despite her company being in charge of what was ordered, delivered, and responsible for pick up we paid Bliss over 30,000 to act as middleman upon Tara's request."""

It used to be quite cheap, but the prices have gone up slightly, but still a great deal for the amount of food you get. I eat a lot and I am comfortable sharing a dinner order with another person. If you like chicken with spices, definitely get the half chicken dinner. If you love beef, definitely recommend the sultani dinner. It comes with pieces of burg or filet mignon and it's amazing. Definitely make sure you get the white sauce as well. If wanting to try something new, I'd recommend boulani and the Kheer. Not for everyone but I tend to like it.

I found it interesting that they would cook it like a souffle or pot pie but, as according to our server, the crust was not meant to be eaten but rather a means to lock in fragrance, flavour, and moisture. I sampled my friend's butter chicken some time after having finished with the dum pukht and found it relatively bland (like going from eating something so complexly flagrant to something as simple as chicken in cream of tomato soup)--they insist it was delicious so maybe I'll try it before eating something heavily spiced.

We decided on Kwality Sweets as they are very familiar with this place. I really enjoyed having all of the dishes on the menu explained to my by my extended family, I defer to them as they are the experts on this type of cuisine ;)  I ordered paneer pakora as my starter. The best way to describe this is like deep fried mild cheese, served with a spicy sweet sauce. This is one of my very favourite Indian fast foods, I just love it and could eat this all of the time!  We also enjoyed gol cuppe, which are little fried puffs that you stuff with a mixture of chick peas and potatoes, dunk into very spicy water, then pop into your mouth for a flavour explosion! So so so yummy!!!  We ordered a tandoor mixed grill for the table with Afghan and Haralyi chicken, and a goat kabob. The meats were super flavourful and tender.  For my main I selected a thali, which is a platter of veggie dishes that you select yourself which comes with rice, salad, dhai (yogurt) and a sweet of your choosing. I chose the aloo gobi (potato cauliflower curry), mutter paneer (cheese and peas in gravy), and the galab jamun (round little sweet ball). It was all very tasty and fresh, I just loved it!  My BF ordered an amazing dosa, which comes with various dips, including an amazing coconut chutney - very tasty! I liked how you can actually watch the dosa chef making the dishes in the restaurant, lots of talent that man had!  To wash it all down, I ordered a special Indian coffee which my BF's mom recommended (not sure of the name but try to order it when you are here - so good!).  You can even order sweets by the pound or ice cream on your way out!  Overall, a very busy place but great to try if you are new to Indian food or have been enjoying it for years!"""

To summarize five months of aggravation and poor customer service:  *. 75% of all calls drop.  This happens whether in my home office or anywhere I may go.  I work from home and my boss has recently had to talk to me about my phone issues impacting work!    *. I've been to the MetroPCS store near me twice to explain my issues and to say they could care less is an Understatement.  They had no answers or recommendations  *. Shortly after switching to MetroPCS I found out I had to pay extra monthly for the ability to join any conference calls.  I couldn't believe it and think it's quite a scam   *. The charger that came with the phone barely works. The battery is rarely above 10% and takes forever to even get to that point.  The phone I was given is awful.  It's a Moto E5 Play and it's junk.  Almost every call has issues. I keep the phone sitting on my desk and don't touch it it hold it to my ear during business calls.  Without even touching the phone, it will put someone on mute, speaker or hold.  I'll be in the middle of a business conversation and it will start dialing someone in my contacts. ONE OR ALL FOUR OF THESE ACTIONS HAPPEN ALMOST EVERY SINGLE CALL. IT'S GOTTEN SO BAD COLLEAGUES AND CLIENTS HAVE NOTICED AND COMPLAINED TO MY BOSS. THIS IS EMBARRASSING, UNPROFESSIONAL AND PUTS MY JOB IN JEOPARDY.  *.

The sales people I interacted with were all great. The vehicle was in a different location and had to be transported to Bedford before I officially bought it. When I came in to sign the final paperwork I was in a bit of a hurry and didn't bother closely inspecting the vehicle to ensure that everything was as it should be. I figured a big name brand like Enterprise wouldn't try to pull a fast one, so to speak, in the same way that a ""Buy Here Pay Here"" auto lot might. That was clearly my mistake.  As can be seen in the original listing on their website here [1], this vehicle was explicitly sold as having trim level 4.  It instead has the base trim level [2]. I've highlighted the falsely advertised features from the listing here [3]. And as an example, so you can see for yourself, here [4] is a picture of the heated seat buttons that I was expecting to find one chilly morning a few days after purchase. This [5], however, is what I found. And so on for the other promised features.   These particular trim features were the reason that I decided to go with this vehicle. If I wanted the basic trim level I would have chosen a less expensive vehicle.   Beyond just the trim, though, I came to discover that the rear storage lock buttons [6] are completely missing [7]!   It goes without saying that this is all extremely frustrating and disappointing. I will not be returning and I'll be encouraging friends and family to go elsewhere as well.

From that point on I was very happy with the way he cut it. I keep my hair longer a bit on top, and close on the sides. I didn't want it flat-out shaved.   Expertly, with shears, Mike faded up my hair to a really clean cut that was all styled out. I'm not a ""faded"" haircut kind of guy when it comes to my hair, but this cut is really awesome. Just the right amount of length on the sides, some length on the top, and cleaned up all over.   The cut even finished with an old-school style vacuuming of my head to remove all hair. Lol.. if you never had this.. you are in for a treat. I used to go to barber shops as a kid with my Dad, and they would finish by literally vacuuming your head and neck so no hair would be left over. Mike even cleaned up my neckline with a hot lather and shave.   The man is a star. He has serious cutting skills, and I have found my new barber.

380;F;0.6461618091356497;"""Well where do I start.... I have absolutely no reason to lie or stretch the truth.   Almost two months ago my wife and I visited the dealership and placed an offer in on a white 2018 Cadillac XTS we seen in the Auto trader, we could not come to an agreement on price. I have zero issues with our offer being turned down, so I thanked the sales person Sean Charles for his time, and told him it was nice to meet you. Everything was very professional that day.  Well... fast forward a month or so, Life got busy for us and we had not purchased yet. I went back on the Auto trader website Saturday April 27th and found they had dropped the price to $38570. My original offer was $38000.  I contacted Sean Charles via email and asked if my original offer would purchase that same car....couple back and forth emails, then I had him call my cell. I told him.... I don't think I can make it in today, this was about    3:45 pm. Sean Charles then told me I could use my credit card over the phone for the deposit. I was not comfortable with that as I wanted to inspect the paint a bit more. I told him I will try and make it in. Sean Charles then told me ""this deal is only good for today"" WELL.... I was at my father in laws 80th birthday party, and a 25 min drive away. Me the dummy fell for his line.... ""this deal is only good for today"".  So, I told the 40 or so people at the party... we will be back in less then 2 hours. just have to make a quick purchase... A car.  I arrived and inspected the car for about 5-10 mins...all good. this is where things take a real bad turn. The papers I thought I would be signing was a bill of sale...not so. after I signed an agreement to purchase at $38000 Sean Charles said he had to see Ian MacDonald (manager) run it by him.   I thought that was really strange...run it by him? we had a deal.....a deal that was good for today.  So, Sean Charles comes back.....I was shocked, no deal. the deal we talked about, not only over emails... but on the phone. I'm a no games kind of person and 100% honest. I truly thought I was dealing with the same.  So I'm not sure if the used car manger (Ian MacDonald) knew what Sean Charles was up to or not, all I know is that for $570 they completely wasted my time..... with that one big lie.  I'm sure someone from Leggat will comment on this review saying I misinterpreted what Sean was saying...NOT SO. He 100% lied to me and my wife. We  believed we were purchasing the car for $38000.   MY father once told me ..... If your talking to a car sales person and their lips are moving,  most likely they're lying.   If you do end up going to Leggat... PLEASE do not use Sean Charles as your sales person.   And Sean please don't waste peoples time with your lies!!  And now they have lowered the price below my asking price.

The fact that I loved their food so much made me sign them up to cater at our wedding reception in October. I had talked to the manager way back in April, decide the menu, talked about the pricing etc. Then in September I called them to make sure we were on track with everything and the manager I had talked to was nowhere to be seen and there was a ""temporary"" manager in his place. He had no idea about any of the things I had talked about with the previous guy, they had kept no records of it, which was very stressful. At that point, we should have found some other place, but we didn't. We went about the whole thing over again, and had to negotiate the price because his price was much higher than what we were quoted earlier (thank god I had it all in my diary). We walked out of the restaurant at least knowing that we would get good food served at the wedding. Then two days before the wedding I called to make sure everything was in place, and the manager had changed AGAIN! This new guy, Reddy, had no idea what I was talking about and told me they couldn't cater on such short notice! Having stressed out enough, I raised some voice and the owner called me and he knew what he was talking about, and I am so thankful he did. However, at the wedding, these guys brought all the food and NO utensils to serve the food with! Also, they promised us three servers but only two were on the venue at any given time. Also, in spite of telling them to make the Veg Biryani mild, they made it spicy. I am so mad, I will never even think of eating at this, or any other location again, and will NEVER recommend their catering to anyone.  If you want your event to go smooth, do not even think of having these guys cater. Very unprofessional and mismanaged!"""

We watched the episode while sitting in the movie theater-style seats (some sat on couches) and what looked like sheet hanging on the far wall. It looked like it could stand an ironing.   The episode was played off of someone's HBO Go account, and it kept arbitrarily stopping. I imagine this was from all the people out there watching the episode at the same time. Watching it with a room full of geeks in Vegas had the effect was I looking for with everyone getting amped up and excited at all the right parts. It was a good group. Once it was over, everyone flooded into the hall to discuss what they saw and how it fit with the book.   Honestly, there wasn't much to the rest of the shop (at least, not while we were there). They had wire racks of magazines and a display case with collectibles that also served at the concession stand. The popcorn was pretty good.

Second attempt was a week later with success of getting a voice mail.  Regardless of multiple voice mails, no one called me back to schedule the appointment.  I tried again a few days later and behold I got a live person.  When I talked to the other person on the call in regards to the service, I came soon to realize that there were additional costs that was not revealed.  At the end of the call, I was able to schedule two appointments, one for my daughter and one for my car, and we agreed that I would pay a total of $50.  My daughter was first to schedule for the service, when she arrived at the location she was asked questions about her car and signed the receipt. The technician took her key and started to drive to the back for service.  To my daughter's surprise he u-turn the car and told her to reschedule because she had tints on the window and it will take additional time to work on.  In addition, she was told she had to pay extra!  You would think being a professional in their work, they would ask all of these questions when I first talked to the guy.  So, she had to wait another week to bring back the car!   Then it was my appointment a few days later.  I arrived and went thru the whole process of signing in.  The receptionist went out to look at my car and went back in to print out a receipt for a balance of $50 and told me I had to come back because I had tinted on my window. So, I tried to be flexible and not frustrated with the rescheduling, I went back to work.  Later on that day, the receptionist called me and told that they will charge me another $70 to remove the existing film.  That is a total of $130 out of pocket on top of the two vouchers!  I was surprised because she said nothing when I was there.  Unbelievable, right! So I called back trying to understand why I was not told of the extra charge when I stopped in for the appointment.  She told me she forgot!! You think they would be upfront about it especially when this is their business!  At first I told them I wanted to cancel my appointment because I felt I was being swindled with all these additional charges.  Then, I decided that I will only redeem whatever services would be covered under the value of the voucher which is $110.  I called back and talked to a guy name, Daniel, and he agreed to remove the front windows and put on new tint per voucher value.  I dropped off my car at my scheduled appointment at 11 am and was told that it will only take 2-3 hours.  Due to work, I wasn't able to come back until 5 pm.  I arrived there and was told the car was not done.  That was over 6 hours leaving my car at this place!  I got my car around 5:35pm.  Daniel pulled the car from the shop behind the building to the parking lot in front and gave me my car keys. I noticed my seat was pushed all the way back and tried to adjust forward.  The seat wouldn't adjust so I went back in and asked Daniel to come out and take a look. At first he was nice about looking at it and then he accused me of bringing in something that was already broken.  I explained to him that if it was broken then you guys wouldn't be able to push the seat back to work on the windows.  He accused me of sabotaging my own car to put in a claim with his company, like really?? Additionally, he pointed out the disclaimer in the receipt that they are not responsible for any damages.  This gave the business the rights to damage your car without being responsibled for it.  He also pointed out that he did the work for free on my car.  I reminded him that this is NOT free work, I paid for the vouchers to get the services done.  He was rude and I felt belittled.  I should not be treated like that as a customer.   He became verbally threatened toward me and told me I had to leave the premise or he would call the cop. Mind you, I paid for this service and was treated like that.  Besides, I can't even adjust my seat to drive the car out of there. So I offered to call the cop for him as I felt threatened with each second standing there.

419;F;0.9545606994716915;"""This little hostel was great for our short trip to Montreal. We booked three nights in their private ensuite bedroom (bathroom included). It room and bathroom was spacious and clean and it included a desk with chairs, tv, and mini fridge. The WIFI is free and fast and the hotel staff was very kind. They don't have parking available but when I emailed them, they gave me several safe locations to park my car in. I ended up parking at the Complexe Dejardins which was a block away and has 24 hour parking.  My only complaints are in regards to the noise level and security at night. Sainte-Catherine is already a very busy street so it has its city noises at night. It seems that the hotel is located in front of a biker meet up or parking spot so every night between about 9-11:30pm it was extremely loud. For the most part the AC drowned out noises but the real problem was when the motorcycles revved up. This of course, is not the hostels fault but it is something to consider if you need an early night. However, because it is such a busy street I would have liked the security to be better. I got in pretty late every night and the desk attendant never even glanced at me. The stairs are immediately accessible from the front door while the front desk is off to the side a bit so I did have a small concern about the possibility of anyone being able to walk on in and up to one of the floors. The rooms are locked with a single physical key rather than a keycard so that was definitely in the back of my mind.

She began threading before I could even get the words out that I wanted no shaping, and promptly interrupted me, saying she knew what I needed.  She chastised me for not hiring her for my wedding makeup (I've never met her before in my life).  It was a bit more involved than I wanted, but was good enough, when she started to put eyebrow shadow (no idea where that makeup or brush have been) on my freshly raw eyebrows to show what a superior makeup job she would do.  My one goal was to keep my skin pristine for my wedding, and throughout she seemed to have no regard for that.  She also asked many personal questions, and didn't really listen to the answers, but had some rude responses.  She pressed me to get my lips threaded, saying it looked bad.  Against my better judgment I said yes, but kept stressing throughout that my skin, especially lip area, is VERY sensitive.  She ignored my pain, kept going over and over the same raw areas again and again.  She finally did agree that my skin was ""very sensitive"".  When she gave me a mirror, after what seemed like forever, I burst into tears.  I looked mutilated with bumps and swelling, and the skin was even broken on the corner of my mouth as I found out later.

Original pricing was over $200.  But eventually agreed to his $99 *special*. My idea, not my spouses. My spouse decided to do it along with me. We took pictures and each got a white tooth reference. With promises to show at the end of treatment HOW effective this is. I went first into treatment. He sat me in the egg shaped chair and handed me a pair of red safety glasses. Then carefully unwrapped a Q-tip shaped stick with some product on the end and said ""rub this on your gums."" and took off to go to another client's egg chair.   He provided me with NO mirror, and NO further instruction or information!  I tried to get it on my gums  - purely guessing if I was doing it correctly. Questions raced through my head...did he mean outside gums only, or also on the inside gums, is the goo supposed to touch my teeth, what if it does, without a mirror I am just guessing at how accurate I am being, is that ok, am I supposed to keep my lips off my teeth, off my gums, can I talk once I have goo on my gums???? ....  A little more information would have been SUPER Helpful.  But none was given.  When he came back, he handed me a tray with whitening goop. I put it in my mouth and he slid a bright light up to my face.  Although he did not instruct me to keep my mouth open, I figured as much, and so I tried to keep my lips wide open over the tray to allow the light in...  A while later his assistant had me take the tray out and rinse.  He showed back up and THEN said.  ""NOW, THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART.  Listen Carefully!  Your pores are all open so you cannot eat or drink anything for at least the next 6 hours until the pores seal up.  Better if you wait 12 hours. If you do eat or drink, you will stain your teeth.""  WHAT THE *%#$^$*  I said ""ARE YOU SERIOUS? You are telling me this NOW?  You should have told us this BEFORE we agreed in the first place!! We are on vacation and it is dinner time now!""   He then said ""OR....  for another $100 each you can have the instant seal treatment that will only take another 10 minutes.  If you do that, then you can eat or drink anything immediately as it instantly seals the pores on the teeth surface.""   I was absolutely Furious!  I said ""No freaking way! We are Not spending Another $200!""  He knew how pissed off I was and then offered another *special* and said both of us could have the sealant for $99 total.  So, we are into this $300 and my spouse would go ape shit crazy if they knew about the whole open pores revelation AFTER we did the process, no eating for 6 hours --  OR the ransom fee of $99 being offered for the sealants...  I chose to pay the ransom of $99.  NO comparisons on the tooth shades were offered up.  I peeked in the a mirror at the register and I was horrified.  My gums had about 5 sizable WHITE spots around the gum line / between teeth - and were  burning so badly!  The lady said ""oh that will go away"".  Well it looks JUST AWFUL!  and to make matters worse, my teeth looked the exact same -no whiter at all. My spouses teeth were slightly whiter.  But I did not want to reveal just how badly my mouth hurt, so I tried to pay the bill as casually as possible and just get the heck out of there as quickly as possible....  But the lady ringing us up then tried to sell us another $300 - $600 worth of take home supplies and product!  OMG.  I was losing my mind with anger. This was the biggest RIP OFF.   So how it did it end?  The white spots did go away. Literally.  The white areas were extremely sensitive and sluffed off in a blister like fashion with brushing & flossing - leaving BRIGHT RED and bleeding gums. Four days later I visited my dentist back home with trashed gums. My dentist informed me the whitening chemical BURNS the gums so you have to be extremely careful with the gum swab to ensure you get the gum area coated around each tooth.

At my appointment he tells me that all it needs is to get a ""code"" electronically downloaded from the main company. He charged me $158.   NO new parts were needed. The entire process took 1.5 hours where as at Canadian tire they said that it is a 3-4 hours process ( each hour is about s 100 dolllars for labor) and wanted me to buy and install parts in my car which it did not need.

I am not a machines and cardio guy, and I understand that Anytime is a smaller quick gym for the basic gym goer.  This Anytime Fitness however is amazing. Full dumbbell rack, 3-4 flat and adjustable flat benches, 2 squat racks one of which is set up with bumper plates and a wood/composite floor for Olympic/deadlifts, a bench press specific bench (rather than the multi-use squat rack that always gets too busy to use at other locations) and a great dual cable set up cable rack. It also has adequate mirror around the free weight squat area for form checking (and gym selfies)  There are also tons of lower impact weight machines to use that are separated from the free weight area. Best of all the cardio equipment is on a second floor. It really eases up that ""busy"" feel all gyms get around 5 o'clock. It all looks to be really nice equipment but I can't comment much further because I don't really use it.  The trainers here seem friendly and while I haven't worked with them I have watched how they interact with clientele. It annoys me when trainers don't interact or seem to actually care about their clients. That isn't the case here. They really seem to make an effort good working relationship.  This is the BEST Anytime Fitness I've been to. It's huge, I like the atmosphere, and I pass 3 other ones just to come here."""

As for the food, the lamb shank was a bit under seasoned, but laid on top of a bed of fresh peppers and zucchini. The salmon was cooked perfectly, but nothing extraordinary. The most outstanding dish was the avocado shrimp cocktail. It is not your typical shrimp cocktail where cold shrimp is hanging off a cocktail cup; it is consists of seasoned grilled shrimp over an avocado salad. Absolutely delicious and original! For dessert, the apple tart was good, but it is not what you imagine when someone says apple tart. It is more like the apple tart contents were placed on top of a fluffy pastry. The winner was the chocolate banana pudding. It was warm, with molten chocolate all over it, in a small ceramic pot-like dish. Both desserts are big enough to share between 2 people.

I walked in and a really friendly guy took my order. Slammed with work though, I browsed the menu (kabobs, gyros, falafels, etc. etc.) and got a chicken shawerma sandwich to go. I was offerred to make it a combo meal with a fries and a drink but I declined - I'm not McD'ing my Middle Eastern lunch.   As I waited, I surveyed the scene. Pleasant enough inside - wooden tables, random Middle Eastern knicknacks on the shelves, faux bricks painted on the walls, whatnots. No music, but hey, it is what it is.  I got my sandwich and headed back to the office. And well, it was decent - not bad by any means, but not great by any means either. The chicken's flavor was extremely mild and there wasn't much of it amidst the lettuce and other goodies. That said, I still inhaled the sandwich in no time.  Now, a simple pita sandwich eaten within the confines of my cubicle isn't the best of gauges of a Middle Eastern restaurant, so I'll definitely have to go back sometime to try some of their kabob platters, but for you folks wandering around west Phoenix feeling condemned to eat Whataburger or Taco Smell, this place offers some respite from the generic norm."""

A day before my 1st appoinment, they called to tell me the doctor wouldn't be around (no reason was given), so the next available time I could book was another two weeks down the road. The receptionist said I could come in and see a tech, but there would be no point, as the tech cannot do the treatment itself.  Appointment day came,  and while I was waiting in line, the woman in front of me was complaining that the staff had already screwed up her booking time once, and now they were trying to tell her that she had to rebook again the day of her scheduled appt, because someone at Hummingbird had 'confused'  the scheduling. She was furious and they didn't deal with her in what i would call a professional manner. There were no apologies, simply excuses.  Then, while sitting in the waiting area, I heard a girl complain that her spa pedicure was just sub par while on the phone with a friend. This should have put me off, and I wish I had left right then.  The doctor came in - late - and didn't have what I would call a friendly bedside manner by any means, and told me to sit in a chair while HE sat on the patients table looking down at me! Then he took a phone call in the middle of my appt! I knew it wasn't work related because he was speaking in his native language.  He then took me to what he called the 'box of despair' which shows you damage to your skin under the surface.  He pointed out minor sun damage and told me it looked really bad. I barely saw what he was referring to. I've worn SPF all my life.I think it's a ploy to freak you out so you use their services.

Note: My skin isn't that bad and my old derm said microdermabrasion would be fine.  He then took me to the area where they sell products and told me I'd need a facial first before the laser treatments to prep the skin, costing another $225. He picked out products that he recommended then set them on the counter at reception where you pay. He then left without saying much. The girl at reception then asked me if I needed a receipt for the products, I said I didn't know I was buying them and asked what they cost. The total was over $200! I was miffed, an told her no, then left. This place is definately lure's you in with cheaper services, then tries to upsell as much as they can.

They kept landing in my food, on my face , in my hair, etc and so forth. I was like, ""What The Heck?""  I looked around and noticed that the place was pretty filfthy and swarming with even more flies. It was pretty disgusting! I left. Too bad because I really liked the food. I wanted to come back and try some other things, but I won't. It only takes one case of previous food poisoning to become very paranoid about things like that.

This summer I sent the machine in for an overhaul, paid the 188$ (or so) fee to have it cleaned up and some minor repairs on it done.

I had always viewed the food as pricey and avoided the location.  However, recently i began to go to this location.  I am a big fan of the chicken dinner (chicken leg, salad and rice) as my go to that spans time and places around the world.  How can you do it wrong, and if you do, how can you still be in business???  Their food is always grilled so its always hot and a little crispy. Their chicken had a completely different taste (GOOD!) and their wild rice is...amazing..whatever the spices...they are good.  I will boldly contest bold c --couldnt resist!-- and say that their food is prepared daily and I have been told it is fresh.  Last summer I had quiet a few 4am visits to the office and the only other person I ever saw in the building was the blonde lady (owner/chef?) at the pumpernickel, toiling away!  So either she was putting out the old sandwiches or making them fresh and the times I forgot my passcard and had to go work at the food court, she was making sandwiches....  Regardless if fresh is what you want to be 100% sure of, stick to the dinners as they go very quickly and the individual components of the meal are replenished daily!  The staff is really friendly too.  The other chef/owner heard me the first time my friend coerced me to check this place out and gave me free water and tried to give me recommendations on what to try.  The second time, the girl who helps serve struck up conversation, remembering my last convo with the chef/owner and even offered me spicy ketchup (their own internal mix they use on the food when they eat it) to spice up my chicken dinner...its the little things that count right (especially for another staff member to just remember me)!

The table I thought was dirty but it was the table UNDER the glass that was filthy and I also noted that there was food splattered all over our booth chairs. The place smelled great though and I thought, just a quick meal, it will be fine. I even drank water tonight to keep things simple. Service was spotty at best. We were a long time sitting without ordering.  To start we were brought some crunchy chick pea chips 'on the house'. Very thoughtful but tasteless.

I asked if they were fresh or frozen and he told me FRESH so I ordered the prawn vindaloo. We ordered jasmine rice on the side as well as Naan bread. Let me tell you, the Naan bread kept me from going out hungry. It was sooo good and warm, buttery. The rice was cold and the beeping of the microwave in the kitchen did not give me confidence about how the rice had once been heated or any of our other food for that matter. The chicken curry had a nice flavour to it and the chicken was well prepared. Hubby had ordered it mild but it came out spicier than my vindaloo and I had specifically asked for mine to be so hot it burned my mouth. Sigh....  I would not get the vindaloo again and I am warning you all that the shrimp did not taste fresh and were so grossly overcooked I had to tell the server, politely of course. They were like flavourless rubber. He advised me that he would tell the chef and that next time he would tell him to make them ""softer"" for me... Oh boy.

613;F;0.9609553006697313;"""I've been a customer here since I believe 2010. Never have I had a problem with this place until new management strolled in about 1 year ago. I plan on moving out soon.  I've never felt so under appreciated as a customer in my life. These guys are all about the money, honey. First thing US Storage did when they took over Best Storage was increase the prices a whopping 33% AND they now require an insurance policy with a minimum $10 extra monthly fee.   When I first started storing my things here in 2010, I had access 24 hours for my business. When new management came in they changed this and stripped away the access. In my head I was thinking oh well I really don't need it to be 24 hours all the time anyways, so I can deal with that.  The next problem that I had was when I received a letter in the mail stating that because I have two locks on my storage units they were going to cut one off from each unit. Not a friendly phone call, a dang letter! Apparently this is not allowed so if you have community storage with somebody don't bother with this place.  After contacting the new general manager, Tiffany Carter (aka Ty), she took a note on my account to CALL me with any problems on my account whatsoever. Like many of you, when it comes to doing business with a company like this, I would like to receive a phone call when something important arises. Don't expect one from US Storage!  I was already near my last straw with this place but I decided to stay anyways. After all, I'm comfortable with the procedures here in general and I like the way the property is laid out.  What happened next is what I would consider to be my final straw.  I increased the number of units that I had from a single storage locker up to three storage lockers over the past year. Apparently, when I added a locker to my account, using the exact same gate password and everything, the company did not add my newest locker to my automatic payment. Easy fix, right?  Not so much with this company. I received an email (not a friendly phone call as I requested earlier and the manager NOTATED on my account) stating that my payment was late and a $20 late fee has been charged (today is the 9th, the paperwork is dated the 8th).  So I email back stating that my accounts have been on automatic payment for YEARS. The general manager Tiffany Carter calls me on the phone and we discuss the confusion.   Let me tell you one thing about this woman. Have you ever heard of the saying ""the customer is always right? Well this woman hasn't, and she is the type that is NEVER WRONG.  We discussed how I use the same pass code for the gate, how everything should be on the same automatic payment card, and how I've been a customer for many years. We seem to have worked it out on the phone, except there was still one problem after we hung up with each other.   This woman may have a soft voice, but don't be fooled, nothing about her is friendly. Once I got off the phone I saw the FULL payment come through on my credit card.  US STORAGE CHARGED ME THE LATE FEE ANYWAYS!  I immediately called Tiffany back and asked her if this was a mistake or if she was for real. She said that she was for real. Once again, she proceeded to NEVER BE WRONG and said why of course there's a late fee, your payment is late. After having to raise my voice in shock over her decision she then goes on to state ""well I can work with the late fee but what I can't work with is you constantly calling me and accusing me of things that don't exist.""  I chuckled a little bit at her poor choice of words and hung up.  Tiffany I'm not going to beg you to take my money and I think you should learn a little something about customer service. I'm more than likely moving out of there because of your attitude and lack of respect for paying customers (albeit long-term loyal customers who can pay the bills and don't have money problems like many of your other tenants may). Everything else about the property I enjoy, except for you and your lack of awareness for customer service.  And congrats for getting an extra $20 out of me but you're losing me as a customer and your company gained this awesome Yelp review.  Was the juice worth the squeeze?"""

615;M;0.366496381557844;"""I didn't want to write a review until my second visit. Having done that this past weekend I can safely say that this is really good BBQ!! My favorite is the brisket which I think is sensational, followed by pulled pork and the chicken. I haven't had the ribs yet so I can't review those obviously.  The BBQ sauce is sort of unique because it's tangy. I am not sure if those are raspberries in there or what, but they give the sauce a nice tang. At first I didn't like the bbq sauce because it was runny and more tangy than I expected, but once I put it in the fridge it thickened up and the flavor settled in perfectly.   What I like most about this place is they use a type of wood which makes the meat real smokey. No clue what type of wood it is. Gf loved the potato salad and beans. The place itself is clean and neat, however it's difficult to find or see from the street because the store sign is hand-drawn and not visible from the street. I'd suggest they change that and put up a big BBQ sign up there. They serve beer on tap but I've only ordered take out so far. The takeout service I've received was always good and food didn't take too long.  I gave it 5 stars even though the bbq strikes me a little bit on the greasy side (which I don't mind but some people may) and prices are a tad above what I'm used to with BBQ places. I'd definitely rate it higher than most BBQ joints on the Wesside."""

671;F;0.9809608145793136;"""Stay away!!!  I have had an awful experience at this place.  I came into this store one day looking for an eternity band to match the wedding ring that I already had. The sales lady was very nice and took my ring back to their shop in the back to examine it so that they could make it the exact same way. She reassured me that they can match the diamonds, setting etc. the price was good so I purchased the ring with an expectation that I would have it within about 3 weeks (with the appraisal). I was super excited because this place seemed to accommodate whatever the customer wanted. This was May 20th. Several weeks later I called and the ring was not done. I got the run around and the sales lady eventually told me that when it came in she wasn't happy with it so she sent it back to get it fixed. She would call when it's done. Ok, no problem, I want the ring to be done right. I waited, and waited and waited. No call. Got the run around and after many empty promises where they say they will call back, no calls...ever. I had to chase them to get any answers. Oh and try talking to anyone who was not involved in the initial sale...Ha! They kept saying they know nothing...so you always have to call at the right time when the sales person who sold you the item is working. Yay me, playing the chase game. After a very frustrating wait, the ring was done...they said to come in! I went, excited to have this ordeal over. The ring was horrible. Setting was off. Diamonds were much more yellow than my wedding band even though I was promised they would match. I was pretty angry at this point. I got the worker to call the manager on the phone to see what she could do. I wanted a refund but 'they don't do refunds'. The manager promised they would fix the setting and diamonds. I left extremely disappointed and went back to the waiting and chasing game. Same thing happened, no calls, the ring took forever again to be fixed. The manager eventually told me to come in as the ring was done! Yay!! Not exactly. They shaved the prongs on the ring and changed some of the diamonds so that every other diamond was yellow still, just awful. I demanded a refunded and they said no, they cannot. I'm not about to throw money away so eventually I agreed to leave my wedding band with them so they can match it exactly. Its now August 7th...over 11 weeks after the initial purchase. No ring. No calls. Nothing. I just called in to get an update and the lady said she had no idea where the ring was, what was happening, manager is on vacation for a week, and the other sales girl will call me when she comes in. Ya, right... When I asked who the manager reports to she told me that 'she is basically the one that takes care of everything'. Then she asked me to be 'patient'. I told her that it's probably a poor choice of words. She agreed. So back to waiting and chasing I go.  All I want at this point is a refund and to never deal with them again. I'll let you all know how it turns out."""

And it happened to be the day they were moving into their new home.  Welcome to the neighborhood!  No injuries, but their driver door was well-smushed and my rear end was dented and a side panel had popped out.  Oh joy!  My USAA auto insurance (another player in this drama) told me to go to Caliber and rent a car from Enterprise (the third player).  So when USAA recommends and uses a vendor you can count on quality and consistency.  So off my wife and I went.  Located on a small road running behind  KFC is a beautiful building with colorful sign.  THIS was Caliber.    I dreaded going in as auto repair, and especially auto body repair, operations are generally gritty, dirty staffed with gritty, stained and dirty employees.  Pleasantly, this was not the case with Caliber.  When we check in, wife and I were astounded at how clean and neat everything was.  The body shop floor was immaculate and polished.  The office neat and comfortable.  And the restrooms very clean.  Further, the receptionist informed us that Enterprise was coming with our rental car!  Amazing.    After completing paperwork with Caliber, we went over to Enterprise to do their paperwork and then home.  Total time to get this done:  less than an hour.  We were told it would be a few days to get the car repaired, but the phone rang at 2pm telling us that the job was done.  Great, but I had to return the rental car.  Caliber informed us that they would return our car to us and then pick up and return our rental car.    The day was ending.  Around 5:30pm Caliber called to tell us that they (two people) were on the way.  By 6pm we had completed their paperwork, paid for the repairs and handed them our rental car.  They took the rental car to their home and returned it to Enterprise the next morning.  We were amazed at how smooth, efficient, courteous and downright nice they were.  This is the definition of outstanding customer service and concern.  Although we do now want to have another collision occasion, we know now that Caliber will get our business.

Everything was the same shade of brown, and the overall impression was that the food had been out for a decent amount of time. Plus, there were few vegetarian options. which are generally my favorite! Thus, we decided to order off the menu, which is a rare occurrence when I step into an Indian establishment.  The most impressive thing about Bombay was our server. He was impeccable. He had worked at another restaurant in town for a brief period of time, and he remembered my name and my husband's occupation. He was incredibly kind and attentive. He recommended the mixed vegetable curry and paneer tikka masala. For $2 extra you get a combo with rice and naan, which brings each entree to around $14.   When the naan first arrived, it was clear we had been served a reheat. As soon as we said something, our server whisked it away and soon returned with hot from the oven, fresh naan. The new naan was good. As for the entrees, the tikka masala was definitely the stand out. I would order it again. However, the mixed vegetable curry reminded me of a Haldiram boxed meal. These meals aren't bad, but when I eat out, I expect a bit more. Some of the vegetables were canned, and the curry flavor didn't seem unique.   On an interesting side note, if you're looking for big, black leather booths (this seems to be a common Vegas request), they have them here. Of course, the fluorescent lighting and Indian fare probably aren't really vintage Vegas.   On the Strip and are craving Indian? This will get the job done."""

The dishes are truly tasty with varying degrees of heat, from extremely mild to thermonuclear. My suggestion is, get a tiny sample of each, try them all in small bites at first, and on your next trips to the buffet trays, indulge in those dishes whose heat level you like. I found pretty much all dishes - meat, veggies and legumes - to be good. The tamarind chutney was a bit watery, and they didn't have mint-cilantro chutney, which is my preferred condiment for taming the heat of this kind of cuisine.

703;F;0.8878005342918724;"""Condensed for Yelp Hot restaurant! Seems the restaurant opened without testing the air conditioning and we, the customers, paid the price. Further, the restaurant was filled with smoke, likely due to a combination of an insufficient exhaust over their authentic charcoal grill and the lack of air conditioning. By the end of the meal, we were all eager to leave as we had begun to cough and my eyes had been tearing since our arrival. Restaurant is well laid out, with unprocessed wood paneling adorning the walls and comfortable booths that offer adequate privacy. Cloth napkins, but the tables were covered in butcher's paper rather than cloth.  Odd mix between classy and casual and we weren't sure what look the restaurant was going for. Charcoal grill is great but seeing the chef, with no hair protection, hat or otherwise, sweating over it made me question what was going on in the areas I could not see of the kitchen. We were offered sparkling or plain water as well as a basket of bread.  In another odd turn, the bread presented was bakery-bought rye bread which was grilled with olive oil, sesame seeds and za'atar which, while tasty, seemed very amateurish as opposed to the fresh rolls, -maybe with sesame seeds and za'atar- which I would normally expect at a high end restaurant. Between the 4 of us, we shared a total of four entrees -appetizers in US-, starting with a delicious hummus topped with sauteed mushrooms -$10-. Next was the spicy Hungarian sausage with peppers, caramelized onions, black olives and tomato sauce -$18-. Sausages had a good spice to them without being too hot and the vegetables mixed well together. But the black olives -actually Kalamata- completely overpowered the sausage and could have in fact been a dish all their own. This was a good thing because we found that after 6 forkfuls, we had plenty of peppers, caramelized onions and black olives but no sausage which was disappointing for a dish where the highlight should have been the sausage. Next to be tried was the duck carpaccio served with salad -$16-.  While we had envisioned a salad complimenting the duck, what were received were -as one of my companions put it- ""six fingernail sized pieces of duck which were 50% fat served over a garden salad with a vinaigrette.""  I made the mistake of trying the duck with the salad and found the flavor of the duck completely overpowered by the vinaigrette. The only redeeming aspect about this dish was that we had ordered 2 servings, otherwise there would not have been enough duck for us each to taste. Lastly came the real star of the entrees which was the beef tartar, served with French fried ""matchsticks"" -$18-. All of us agreed the tartar was excellent with a great mix of green onion, fresh beef and very light seasoning sure to agree with anyone's palette. While I would generally tell those with less adventurous palates to avoid any sort of raw beef dish, this one had a solid consistency which was not unlike tuna tartar, and in a good way. The fine cut of the meat really allowed the flavours to meld and the dish melt in your mouth. I would have liked the tartar to be served with toast points or the like, but was still quite happy to eat it straight from my fork. The only addition I would make to the tartar would be some citrus to really brighten up the flavours and make them pop. For our mains two of us shared the grilled beef bavette -$28- and grilled rack of lamb with wild mushrooms -$55-, both prepared to the chef's recommendations of medium-rare and medium, respectively. The grilled bavette was very good and had an excellent texture, if not simple being seasoned with only salt. Though personally I would have preferred more to be done with the lamb, it was well prepared and served as whole rack with 3 generous ribs. Both juicy and tender, the lamb had the perfect texture, even while being rare in the middle and was one of few things we ordered which had a good value.  In terms of side dishes, together we sampled all 3 on offer which were rice, French fries and vegetables. While the vegetables were unremarkable -they were simply grilled-, the French fries were soggy and oily, while the rice was prepared Mexican style and was reminiscent of a box of ""Near East"" rice one would buy when needing a side dish in a hurry. One companions had salmon tartar -$15- and the other an 18 oz. rib steak -$34-. Salmon tartar was termed as ""tastes fishy and not fresh"" while the steak was prepared to the specified medium, but was seasoned with pepper only and had no flavour otherwise -where's the salt?-.

Not being a sports buff, I can't tell you the names that went with the caricatures, but they were still interesting to look at.   The bisque was quite rich and I could taste the lobster, butter, sherry, and cream.  The ratios were good and I enjoyed the flavor composition.  While eating the bisque, I snuck a sampling of the French Onion soup and was amazed at the flavor.  The onions had actually been cooked to the point of tenderness.  They were bathed in a broth of stock and wine with some tasty cheese and croutons baked into the top.  I have to say, as good as the bisque was I will be returning for the French Onion.  As we finished our soups, our entree arrived to the table with an extra plate -- no need for us to ask.  I went for the french fries -- oh so good.  They were freshly made and fried perfectly.  I then went for the prime rib and carved it up between the two of us.  It was cooked more toward a medium than a medium-rare, but the flavor was spectacular.  I have not had a good prime rib like this in a while.      Throughout the entire meal, our service was impeccable.  Only once did I wonder where our server went.  When she reappeared with our soups she apologized for the wait.  She said that the kitchen had burnt the French Onion slightly and she had had them make it over.  I am usually skeptical about excuses, but I had actually heard some of the other servers talking about how she had made the kitchen remake the soup.  Elaborate hoax or the truth, I don't know.  I do know that I enjoyed the food and the service to the point that I know I will return."""

Starting from the White Rock parking area, you walk through the opening in the wood fence--it's very well marked-- and continue a short distance to the wash.  Go up the wash a short distance and trail comes up out of the wash on the right.  At this point, you're still on the White Rock Loop Trail.  After a bit of uphill hiking, you'll come to a sign that points you to the Keystone Thrust Trail that goes off to the right. From here the trail is 2 miles round trip--an out and back hike.  As you first hike along, it will be a single track trail with lots of black bush and cacti.  After awhile, the trail becomes two lanes--remnants of the old road that was used for two reasons many years ago.  This was a ""chop shop"" place where stolen cars were brought for the parts and then abandoned.  The old road also led to some old mining area.  When you reach the high point behind Hogback Ridge, you can see the results of the thrust.  The older limestone is on top of the younger sandstone rock--the result of the Pacific Plate coming up and over the North Atlantic plate millions of years ago.  There is a use trail to the top of Hogback Ridge and you can see the south end of the Strip--Mandalay Bay, Luxor and the corner of Trop and the Boulevard.  There's also a great view of Red Rock Canyon from there.  Retrace your steps to the car.  Total distance will be about 2.5 miles adding on the little you hike on the White Rock Loop."""

Maybe.  Service is helpful and friendly, and prices are low.  Domestic beer is less than $4 a bottle, and their couple of imports are barely over that.  The Chinese Wok selections are pretty good.

Considering the other places go for over $60 before taxes and tip at $30 this place was a bargain.  I initially still had a bit of sticker shock because I am used to paying $13 with tip for my hair cuts at Chinese salons I am glad I splurged a little since I miss that treatment from when I was back in the Philippines.   Location wise it is a bit in the corner near where club 300 used to be. I was shocked at the news that there is no more club 300  from the barber.  The wet shave and a hair cut require an appointment. However the regular hair cut services you can probably get within 30 minutes of wait. The process took close to an hour but at least they have some movies playing in the background to pass the time.   They have wifi and a charging station for everything except for the newer iPhones. Well the newer iPhones hold charges better anyway but still would like one. :)  It is cash only but they have an ATM if you need it.

Loved the lamb dishes and the juicy chicken tandoori. The looked dry at first but after I cut into it and bit the meat it was juicy. There was one fish dish I saw and it was amazing. It just melted in your mouth. Can't remember the name. The only cons was that it seemed that there was only one server and he was busy getting people's bills and other people's drinks. Had to wait around till he got to our area to order a drink. One other concern there was a chicken dish with lots of sauce. When I cut into the chicken it was raw on the inside. I didn't eat the chicken but I tasted the sauce and it was delicious.  Atmosphere is great to bring first timers to an Indian buffet. Wish there was more fish or seafood dishes.

I must say Carribean Restuarant or otherwise, they do a pretty good job of supplying an interesting Drink Menu.   They use a variety of Rums, and I say they make a good drink.  If you have a date, I recommend you try one of their Martini's - Caramel Martini, Pina Colada Martini, or if you want to clear your sinuses with a kick try a drink with some Ginger in it :)   What makes Thursday a particularly good date night as well is half price apps (the wings do well, they have a good cajun dry rub).  If you make it to about 8:30, the specials are done, but they have Live Entertainment that I would describe as good, not over the top loud, just nice mellow vibe.  So, half price drinks, half price apps, and a calm vibe of Entertainment.  The other night to try is on a Saturday.   They have a consistent party every Saturday - RnB, Soca, Reggae.   DJ Smooth B and rotating DJs.  They have these nice huge heat lamps outside as a summer bonus.  There are many options across Toronto, but if you compare the effort, Rum Diaries compares well.  3 things to look for music, atmosphere, and drinks.  I strongly recommend you start with a Thursday first (take a date).   If you like what they are doing there (I do), check it out on a Saturday.  Write back here what you think."""

I have never been to one before. The closest one to my home is in Pickering. Since this one in Mississauga is a five-minute drive away from work, it made more sense to drop by and give it a try.  It took me a number of iterations to figure out what I wanted. I cycled from a two-piece chicken combo, to the Big Mary (not me) sandwich, to the three-piece chicken combo.  When I first walked in, I noticed the small counter. There were seats, but they are limited. Luckily, we were there at noon. We had first dibs.  I also noticed that one of the middle menu screens was out. It was the menu that would have displayed the chicken tenders that I was about to order. I'm glad that I looked at the online menu before coming in.  Of course, there was a sign that said that there was a hot chicken sandwich combo (it comes with a drink) for $5.99. I love a good hot chicken sandwich, but I already had my mind set on getting the chicken fingers combo.  I placed my order. I could have swapped the taters that come with the combo for a mac and cheese salad. Instead, I wanted to experience everything. So, I got a small mac and cheese salad on the side.  The woman was friendly and asked for my name, so that she could let me know that my order was ready.  The downside going to such an establishment is that whenever someone says Mary, I turn. Ugh!  My order was finally ready. I went to fetch my order and return to the table.  The table is small for four people. We ended up giving back our trays so that we had more space to eat.  My chicken tenders were long in length. This place puts all your food into cute little boxes. As a result, some of my chicken tenders were bent and broken. It wasn't a major catastrophe, but I would be okay if they were jutting out of the box instead of stuffing them into the box.  The tenders were juicy and yummy. They weren't salted to death, which I appreciated. The downside was that I only got one little sweet and sour dipping sauce. I needed two.  The taters were okay. Frankly, I could have done without them. There were way too many that I ended up in a mild carb coma an hour after finishing my meal.  I loved the mac and cheese salad. Next time, I will substitute the taters for this salad. I need to give the coleslaw a try, as my colleague loves it.  My combo came with a canned drink. I went with a Diet Pepsi.  If you are lactose-intolerant, the chicken is dipped in buttermilk, so you may feel some of the effects. I managed to take my lactase pills before I ate, so I was okay.  This place is clean and bright, other than the dim middle menu screen.  I'd come back here to give the regular chicken combos a try. There are a number of specials, depending on when and what day you visit.  (67)"""

I would go back to her again if I need any other body adjustments or have other injuries. My other time was seeing the Physiotherapist for a fractured arm from snowboarding.

(Good call Chad!!) I must admit, I was a little unsure of how we would like it because the reviews on Yelp were a bit mixed.  However, I was impressed with our overall experience.  Even though the restaurant was pretty busy when we arrived, we were seated immediately.    Our service started out a little slow because our waiter was brand-new and did not know the menu.  We had questions, and he had to go get the manager (or owner) to help us.  I did not catch the name of the  manager/owner but he was so helpful and patient with our questions.  He also told us detailed information about some of the dishes and explained some of the differences about the various regional cooking styles & history about how some of the dishes were developed.   Everyone was hungry, so we decided to start with a couple of appetizers. We also ordered off the menu for our entrees - which was good because I am not a big fan of buffets.   Samosa - Crispy pastry turnover, filled with potatoes, peas, spices and herbs Served with chutney-  5 stars.  This was one of the most delicious samosas I have eaten.  The inside was flavorful and the crispy pastry was perfectly cooked.    Gobi 65 - Cauliflower marinated in Corn flour batter & spices, deep fried and tossed with yogurt and spices - 5 stars. Wow, I would have never ordered this if it had not been for the recommendation of the manager/owner.   But it was really delicious!  Naan -  4.5 stars.  The naan was very fresh and tasty.   Chicken Tikka Masala - Cubes of chicken roasted in a tandoor clay oven cooked with mildly spiced tomato gravy and served with basmati rice -  3.5 stars.  While the dish was flavorful, it was not the very best Chicken Tikka Masala I have ever eaten.  I got a 3 out of 6 on the spicy scale and thought the spiciness was just about right.   Chicken Khorma - Pieces of chicken cooked in mildly spiced cream sauce with fresh cilantro (coriander) - 4.5 stars.   Unfortunately, we didn't save room for dessert on this visit but they have some good selections on the menu.  I thought the prices were very reasonable ($67 for 4 entrees, 2 appetizers, 2 orders of Naan, one coke, and one glass of Prosecco)  and the quality of the food was good.

I'd recommend the chicken and beef shish kebabs. The other type (Adana) which is the flat/long kebab is also great.  The only reason I'm giving this a 4 star review instead of 5 is the lack of variety on the menu. It is new and they said they'd add more stuff but they only have 5-7 entrees atm and very little in terms of sides. We went around 7 and they'd run out of some entrees so we only had a choice of 4 and the people who came after us had to be turned away because they'd run out of meat by around 8 PM so the kitchen was closed early. This probably isn't a problem usually but I'd recommend going before 7:30 on Fri/Saturday and hopefully they can solve it by hiring another chef because only one person was cooking so it was slow with 4-5 other groups there.  Overall, I would give this a 5 star review based on the food but they have to improve their menu and those other small issues that come with new restaurants and it would also help to add some promos in like a lunch special or dinner for a big group of people.

After being tattooed for the last six years at Divinity Tattoo in Phoenix my artist, Nicole, decided to move to Massachusetts so I was on the hunt for a new local artist    My wife, courtesy of Facebook, found Kenzi Woods tattoo page on Facebook at damaged Ink.  In Chandler.    My wife and I met with him to set up a consultation and gave him  a $100 cash deposit without receiving any kind of receipt or appointment card, first red flag.    We had an appointment scheduled for two weeks after that at 4:00 PM, when we showed up at about 345, he informed us that he had just taken somebody back to do a tattoo, second red flag       Like many people have posted they do not have a receptionist and it seems like the artist take the tattoo appointments Themselves and don't bother to write anything down.      After a very painful and heavy handed tattoo session, I left the shop   My tattoo healed horribly and the end result is quite a bit of scarring on my arm which is bright red. Once the scarring became apparent I reached out several times to Kenzie to discuss with him that I was not happy with my tattoo, the way it healed, the scarring because he went over the areas too much, and the fact that I did not like the end result which was quite a bit of scarring on my arm which is bright red.  I reached out several times to Kenzie to discuss with him that I was not happy with my tattoo and the fact that I did not want to have any more work done with him and wanted my deposit back.  At the time I paid my deposit, nobody told me that the deposit was nonrefundable.  The only way to communicate with Kenzie was to con tact him through Facebook messenger as he did not answer phone calls and texts...at the end of my conversation with him he told me ""I'm sorry refunds are not refundable sorry for the inconvenience ""and then if I ""wanted to do more work he would hold my deposit for 60 days ""and then he proceeded to block me on Facebook!!!  After letting that sink in and letting my anger subside I reached out to the owner of the shop Jason who instructed me to text him between the hours of 1 PM at midnight as a tattoo was very late I called him once, left two separate text over a two day period. And then waited a final day to hear back, which I did not  Please be warned, avoid the shop my tattoo that was $200 and it up costing me $300 because my artist refused to give my deposit back because I did not want to do future work with him    The result is a tattoo I'm not happy with scarring on my arm from his heavy handedness and overall just pleasure with my tattoo which is located on my forearm for everybody to see. Avoid the shop. On other yelp and Facebook reviews I see the owner reaching out to people that leave negative reviews to comment or ask them to remove the review so that they can resolve, it he has not done any of that which is very surprising    Again avoid the shop unless you want to get ripped off for your deposit !!!

873;F;0.9401507378563481;"""In our quest to find interesting ideas for a caterer for our wedding, my fiancé and I found ourselves somewhere pretty foreign to me: Masson street in Rosemont. I have been before - but mostly when I was a young kid visiting my great grandmother in the area. Otherwise, quite a dark zone in my city knowledge. We found ourselves there to visit Casa Vinho, a Portuguese restaurant working with wood charcoal - supplied by my future father-in-law - hence why we visited to see what maybe they could do for us from a catering point of view.   Casa Vinho is a family run restaurant that specializes in grilling on charcoal. The space is classic Portuguese restaurant decor - bright colors, lots of seaside paintings and other trinkets around Portuguese culture. Personally, I found the music a little too loud to have real conversation but otherwise no complaints.  Starting off, of course, I needed to go with the cod cakes. I can't imagine going to a Portuguese restaurant and not ordering these. Nice crunch on these and good flavours but not the texture I love. The cod had a very smooth, pureed texture. I like more of the filament-like texture of the cod to come through.  Our other entrée was some grilled calamari - served with a pepper salsa on top. The calamari was excellent - nice and fresh. Beautifully firm but tender texture. Grilled nicely as well. The salsa brought a hint of acidity and sweetness to the dish. Hit the spot nicely.  Our first main was grilled squid served with roasted vegetables, rice and the pepper salsa again. The squid was exquisite. Great fresh flavour, nice sear on the outside and nice tenderness in general. The salsa once again worked well with the dish and the sides were plentiful. This is the kind of squid I hope to get when I order some. Wonderful.  And then, of course, we have the Portuguese chicken. First thing - the portion is huge. Very generous for the price. As for the chicken itself, it is wonderful. The chicken is moist and juicy. The skin is nicely crisp and charred from being grilled over wood charcoal. As I am a weakling, I went with the less spicy sauce. Nice heat still but with a subtle finish. The classic sides of salad and fries were great as well. Exactly what you want from this dish. Excellent dish all around.  To finish, I needed to get my Pasteis de Mata. Classic and wonderful as always. Great hint of vanilla within the custard. Nice flaky crust. A perfect classic finish to a solid meal.  Casa Vinho was a solid experience from beginning to end. Classic Portuguese is always delicious when done well and they definitely strike the right notes. While we didn't go with them in the end for logistic reasons, I can definitely recommend them if you are looking for a nice meal in Vieux Rosemont.  Cheers!"""

There was excitement, there were tears but ultimately the kids had a great time and that's the goal we had in mind for this place. It's important to have options where you can take your child out during the weekends when the weather is too cold or in this case, the weather being raining and sad.   I'd say the age range for this place would be ideally around to 2 to 5. Any younger they may not enjoy it a whole lot and if they are older they'd be better off in places of mayhem such as Funtropolis next door. I strongly recommend coming here with more than 1 kid as they'll keep themselves busy instead of dragging you from place to place.  Overall, I quite enjoyed my experience. While another Yelper pointed out that it's not really a museum, I disagree. After-all, a museum is an exposition to be displayed to public and the variety of different room setups makes it so.   And there's plenty of them!  Rooms :  - Grocers with a truckload of accessories and food carts. Kids can even pretend to be cashiers! Their first part-time job! Our kids had a blast here.  - Vet clinic with plenty of stuffed toys and appropriate setup that made it fun for the kids.  - A classroom with children's desks and chalkboard. Not overly popular but hey, it was neat.  - A fast food resto (not a real one but fake food all over the place!). Kids were hoarding the junk food toys. Future Yelpers in the making.  - ""The Architect Room"" where kids can play with bouncing balls in a variety of architectural structures that makes it intriguing and fun. I enjoyed this room the most.  - A construction zone where there's a construction rig you can use, fake power toys that make noise and fake foam bricks they can build towers and walls with. Kids really enjoyed this place as well as the firetruck across the room.  - A discotheque where there's a stage and lights. Kids can dance and ""sing"" on the microphone. The Frozen song was playing on a loop, so heaven for some people or like me, a place to void.  There were others, like a farm, old gutted police truck and ambulance, an airplane, a NASA shuttle, a cave grotto (scary for kids this age though). All in all, plenty to keep kids happy and busy for some time. We were here for 3 hours.  Price-tag is OK though I'd make parents pay less.  Would be back."""

The mussels and shrimp looked like they were there for many days.  They ran out of pop(coke to be exact). I will never go back again."""
988;M;0.38662133305632423;"""Nice rest stop during your touring shopping day.  Wide range of snacks and drinks for the weary.  A few small benches outside to sit and enjoy and people watch.  The ice cream was just ok for us 3/5, but the convenience and wide variety of items bumped it up a star."""
989;F;0.6479759214924486;"""Great service, Very reasonable pricing and Very Efficient. Very friendly staff and very organized business. Will use again if needed."""
990;M;0.5025783825109118;"""Service is ok, product are ok. It does have lot of random stuff though! they even have coffee, a petshop place. They only things they don't have is furnitures and grocery. I bought some stuff, this Canadian tires is not quite busy and it's quite huge."""
991;M;0.4488585085562243;"""Just a quick update to advise against the combos listed on the wall. While they're a good value --hovering around the $10-13 mark for two or three items-- throwing them all in the same container is a disaster. By the time we got home our chili chicken, mixed veg and lamb curry were one. Still tasted good, but I wish we had got them in separate containers.  Other than that, keep calm and curry on, KP."""
992;F;0.8386728124504207;"""Amazing! This place truly deserves a 10! As soon as we parked the car and entered the parking lot....this incredible aroma of charcoal BBQ and meats enter the air and You automatically start salivating and searching... Search with your eyes, 'where this amazing smell is coming from?!?' And there it was... KAVKAZ!  At the front entrance you are welcome by a very inviting sign that says $9.95 lunch special!  OF COURSE  we were automatically interested and entered, to learn more... We were wowed, fist impression: the place was beautiful, cozy and updated, clean and relaxing ambiance and friendly staff! Very welcoming workers and kitchen staff, everyone was very helpful and knowledgable.  Although they do not advertise their food as gluten free, the head chef / owner was more then happy to come out and not only break down exactly what's in what but also explained the way the food was prepared! We unfortunately could not stay, to eat inn but definitely got 1 order of take out to try at home. For $9.95 I got a huge container of Succulent Chicken shish kabob, it was juicy and full of flavor, sprinkled with fresh onions and herbs. On the side we got freshly sliced and fried potatoes smothered in herbs oil and fresh dill.  This combo also came with a side order of soup (2 to chose; harcho or borscht) I strongly recommend both! and a container of dills And a side of fresh bread.  Not only was this an amazing deal! But I almost ' swallowed my tongue' (is what we say when something is this delicious! ) mind you it took me 2 attempts to finish the whole portion, due to it being so generous!  Many of you who know me, know that my family and I do not shy away from eating our regularly and treating ourselves to high end cuisine and restaurant, from Blu Restaurant in yorkville to Harbour sixty, and many more like it, we've been fortunate enough to have had these experiences, and although this by all means is no high end posh restaurant, it's beautiful interior and incredible food is what made us fall In love! We will be returning and coming back for more and more!! 100% I strongly recommend everyone try's this place and support their business and let's hope they will open more locations!"""
993;M;0.8658263386003753;"""Me and my wife's first visit to this place. Ordered calamari which was just perfect with the sauce. The Thai Chlli Fish along with the mixed veg fried rice was good with not too much of spice. My wife ordered the coconut rice for desert and loved it with the pieces of mango in it. The ambience is decent with no extras and the staff especially (the lady serving) very courteous and accommodative. Very happy with the price too."""
994;F;0.9824268823595749;"""When I bought my home 9 years ago, the floor looked pristine. I was new to home ownership and little did I know how disgusting grout could get.  Fast-forward to two kids and two dogs later, the grout was no longer its original color.  It was black. It was gross. It was shameful.  We had it professionally cleaned and sealed by Sears. It was not cheap and the results were disappointing.  So, I had low expectations when my husband suggested we clean it again (I was ready to just tear up the entire floor).   We used A Fancy Floor per an online recommendation.  When I was quoted the price, my response was, ""that's it?""  It was a fraction of what Sears charged me.  Not only was it significantly cheaper, but the result was significantly better.  Yes, the floor still has grout. But it's not black. It's not gross. It's not shameful.  A Fancy Floor was quick, arrived on time (even a little early), very polite, and took a lot of pride in their work.  I highly recommend them if your floor is dirty. It's worth it."""

998;F;0.8340010393444253;"""Over the last couple of years I have eaten here with a friend who loves sushi! I don't eat raw fish!   So i always get the Bento box; California rolls, Chicken Teriyaki, Vegetable Tempura  and 2 Shrimp Tempura and it comes with the miso soup, salad and fresh fruit. The regular price is about $8 but you can also get this as a lunch special for about $6.   The food is always fresh, hot and delicious. The decor is trendy to upscale yet you can walk in with jean shorts and a t-shirt and not feel out of place. There is this one male server we always get and he is hilarious and fun! He even got me to try a new dish which he comp'd! I wish I could remember his name, he never has a name tag on. Great guy!  Considering Sushi Supreme is on Yonge St it is super clean as well. From the restaurant to the washrooms, a plus plus in my books!!"""
999;F;0.6041185463997065;"""Wouldn't recommend going here for buffet. It is over crowded and food is always cold. They have better service at ala carte.  The variety of food is very authentic, true to its roots - the southern part of India. Flavors are distinctive to every dish and not like the usual- one sauce for all the items on the menu."""
1000;F;0.7318407136513775;"""Great prices, with spicy flavourful food. Hakka king honestly never disappoints, it's flavour profile caters to the south Asian population in Markham well.   Is it healthy food? Nope. But deep fried spicy paneer is hard to beat. Work out that extra 30 mins a day before you come here but it's worth it.  Decent prices, good flavour. Great for takeout or to sit in and eat."""
